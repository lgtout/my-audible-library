window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Where do we go when we die? Or is there nowhere to go? Is death something we can do or is it just something that happens to us? </p> <p>Now in his ninth decade, former Bishop of Edinburgh, Richard Holloway, has spent a lifetime at the bedsides of the dying, guiding countless men and women towards peaceful deaths. In <i>The Last Bus</i>, he presents a positive, meditative and profound exploration of the many important lessons we can learn from death: facing up to the limitations of our bodies as they falter, reflecting on our failings, and forgiving ourselves and others. But in a modern world increasingly wary of acknowledging mortality, <i>Waiting for the Last Bus</i> is also a stirring plea to reacquaint ourselves with death. Facing and welcoming death gives us the chance to think about not only the meaning of our own life, but of life itself; and can mean the difference between ordinary sorrow and unbearable regret at the end. </p> <p>Radical, joyful and moving, <i>Waiting for the Last Bus</i> is an invitation to reconsider life's greatest mystery by one of the most important and beloved religious leaders of our time. </p>";
