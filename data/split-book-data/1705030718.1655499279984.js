window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A path-breaking journey into the brain, showing how perception, thought, and action are products of \"maps\" etched into your gray matter - and how technology can use them to read your mind.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Your brain is a collection of maps. That is no metaphor: Scrawled across your brain's surfaces are <i>actual maps</i> of the sights, sounds, and actions that hold the key to your survival. Scientists first began uncovering these maps more than a century ago, but we are only now beginning to unlock their secrets - and comprehend their profound impact on our lives. Brain maps distort and shape our experience of the world, support complex thought, and make technology-enabled mind reading a modern-day reality, which raises important questions about what is real, what is fair, and what is private. They shine a light on our past and our possible futures. In the process, they invite us to view ourselves from a startling new perspective.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Brainscapes</i>, Rebecca Schwarzlose combines unforgettable real-life stories and cutting-edge research to reveal brain maps' surprising lessons about our place in the world - and about the world's place within us.</p>";
