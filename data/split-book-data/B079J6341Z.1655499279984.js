window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A caustic criticism of nearly every philosophic predecessor and a challenge of traditionally held views on right and wrong, Friedrich Nietzsche’s <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> paved the way for modern philosophical thought. Through nearly three hundred transformative aphorisms, Nietzsche presents a worldview in which neither truth nor morality are absolutes, and where good and evil are not opposites but counterparts that stem from the same desires.</p> <p><i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> was a foundational text for early twentieth-century thinkers, including philosophers, psychologists, novelists, and playwrights. Today’s readers will delight in Nietzsche’s pithy wit and irony while gaining a deeper understanding of his core ideology.</p> <p>AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or revisit an old favorite, these new editions open the door to the stories and ideas that have shaped our world.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: Previously published as </b><b><i>Beyond Good and Evil</i></b><b>, this edition of </b><b><i>Beyond Good and Evil (AmazonClassics Edition)</i></b><b> includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";
