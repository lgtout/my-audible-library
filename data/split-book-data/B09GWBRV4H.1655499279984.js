window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Modern culture is obsessed with identity. </b></p> <p>Since the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision in 2015, sexual identity has dominated both public discourse and cultural trends — yet no historical phenomenon is its own cause. From Augustine to Marx, various views and perspectives have contributed to the modern understanding of the self.</p> <p>In this timely audiobook, Carl Trueman analyzes the development of the sexual revolution as a symptom — rather than the cause — of the human search for identity. Trueman surveys the past, brings clarity to the present, and gives guidance for the future as Christians navigate the culture in humanity’s ever-changing quest for identity.</p>";
