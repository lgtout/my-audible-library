window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A personal journey into our evolving relationships with animals, and a thought-provoking look at how those bonds are being challenged and reformed across disciplines</b></p> <p>We love animals, but does that make the animals' lives any happier? With factory farms, climate change, and deforestation, this might be the worst time in history to be an animal. If we took animals' experiences seriously, how could we eat, think, and live differently?</p> <p><i>How to Love Animals</i> is a lively and important portrait of our evolving relationship with animals, and how we can share our planet fairly. Mance works in a slaughterhouse and on a pig farm to explore the reality of eating meat and dairy. He explores our dilemmas over hunting wild animals, over-fishing the seas, visiting zoos, and saving wild spaces. What might happen if we extended the love we show to our pets to other sentient beings? In an age of extinction and pandemics, our relationship with animals has become unsustainable. Mance argues that there has never been a better time to become vegetarian or vegan, and that the conservation movement can flourish, if people in wealthy countries shrink their footprint.</p> <p>Mance seeks answers from chefs, farmers, activists, philosophers, politicians, and tech visionaries who are redefining how we think about animals. Inspired by the author's young daughters, his book is a story of discovery and hope that outlines how we can find a balance with animals that fits with our basic love for them.</p>";
