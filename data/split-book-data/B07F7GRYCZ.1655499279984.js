window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Drawing on decades of experience, a psychotherapist and Zen practitioner makes the Abhidharma - the original psychological system of Buddhism - accessible to a general audience for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Abhidharma, one of the three major text collections of the original Buddhist canon, explores the critical juncture of Buddhist thought and the therapeutic aspects of the religion and meditation. It frames the psychological system of Buddhism, explaining the workings of reality and the nature of the human mind.&nbsp;Composed of detailed matrices and lists that outline the interaction of consciousness and reality, The Abhidharma explores the essence of perception and experience, and the reasons and methods behind mindfulness and meditation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because of its complexity, the Abhidharma has traditionally been reserved only for academic or monastic study; now, for the first time, clinical psychologist Beth Jacobs makes this dynamic, important text and its teachings available to general audiences, using practical explanation, personal stories, and vivid examples to gently untangle the technical aspects of the Abhidharma.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jacobs' work&nbsp;illuminates this classic of Buddhist thought, highlighting the ways it can broaden and deepen our experience of the human psyche and offering profound insights into spiritual practice.</p>";
