window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Pulitzer Prize, Biography/Autobiography, 2013</b></p> <p>By the author of the internationally best-selling biography <i>The Orientalist, The Black Count</i> brings to life one of history’s great forgotten heroes: a man almost unknown today yet with a personal story that is strikingly familiar. His swashbuckling exploits appear in <i>The Three Musketeers,</i> and his triumphs and ultimate tragic fate inspired <i>The Count of Monte Cristo.</i> His name is Alex Dumas. Father of the novelist Alexandre Dumas, Alex has become, through his son's books, the model for a captivating modern protagonist: The wronged man in search of justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Born to a Black slave mother and a fugitive White French nobleman in Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti), Alex Dumas was briefly sold into bondage but then made his way to Paris where he was schooled as a sword-fighting member of the French aristocracy.&nbsp;</p> <p>He was only 32 when he was given command of 53,000 men, the reward for series of triumphs that many regarded as impossible, and then topped his previous feats by leading a raid up a frozen cliff face that secured the Alps for France. It was after his subsequent heroic service as Napoleon’s cavalry commander that Dumas was captured and cast into a dungeon - and a harrowing ordeal commenced that inspired one of the world’s classic works of fiction.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Black Count</i> is simultaneously a riveting adventure story, a lushly textured evocation of 18th-century France, and a window into the modern world’s first multi-racial society. But it is also a heartbreaking story of the enduring bonds of love between a father and son. Drawing on hitherto unknown documents, letters, battlefield reports and Dumas' handwritten prison diary, <i>The Black Count</i> is a groundbreaking masterpiece of narrative nonfiction.</p>";
