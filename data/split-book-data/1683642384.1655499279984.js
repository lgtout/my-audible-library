window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Things are not what they seem to be. Nor are they otherwise. (Lama Surya Das) </i></p> <p>You don’t need to spend a lifetime purifying and perfecting yourself in order to touch the bliss of enlightenment. Your essential state of being is already one of pure awareness and incorruptible, innate wakefulness. The question is, how can you access this awakened state? How can you free your luminous true nature?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Directly experience your primordial true self with Dzogchen meditation </b></p> <p>One of Tibetan Buddhism’s most guarded and revered secret teachings, Dzogchen offers a swift and direct path for touching upon your essential nature and scaling the pinnacle of enlightenment in this lifetime. In the West, few understand this path as deeply as American teacher Lama Surya Das, and in <i>Dzogchen Meditation Training,</i> Surya Das draws on his nearly 50 years of experience to present an immersive training in the art and practice of Dzogchen.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also known as the Great Perfection, Dzogchen is grounded in wisdom and compassion. In this six-part series, Lama Surya Das takes you on a journey home to your primordial state of being, the true self that is pure awareness. In this practice-oriented training, you’ll awaken your natural radiance in a way that encompasses - rather than denies - the world and all it means to be fully human. An advanced program that is accessible to everyone, <i>Dzogchen Meditation Training </i>presents a powerful, in-depth series of meditations and inquiries for coming into deeper communion with all of life and uncovering the treasure trove inherent in your authentic radiant nature.</p>";
