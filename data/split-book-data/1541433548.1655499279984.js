window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What will the world look like in 10,000 years - or 10 million? What kinds of stories will be told about us?</b></p> <p>In <i>Footprints: In Search of Future Fossils</i>, the award-winning author David Farrier explores the traces we will leave for the very distant future. Modern civilization has created objects and landscapes with the potential to endure through deep time, whether it is plastic polluting the oceans and nuclear waste sealed within the earth or the 30 million miles of roads spanning the planet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our carbon could linger in the atmosphere for 100,000 years, and the remains of our cities will still exist millions of years from now as a layer in the rock. These future fossils have the potential to reveal much about how we lived in the 21st century.</p> <p>Crossing the boundaries of literature, art, and science, <i>Footprints </i>invites us to think about how we will be remembered in the myths and stories of our distant descendants. Traveling from the Baltic Sea to the Great Barrier Reef, and from an ice-core laboratory in Tasmania to Shanghai, one of the world's biggest cities, Farrier describes a world that is changing rapidly, with consequences beyond the scope of human understanding.&nbsp;</p> <p>As much a message of hope as a warning, <i>Footprints </i>will not only alter how you think about the future; it will change how you see the world today.</p>";
