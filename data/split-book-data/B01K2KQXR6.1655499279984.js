window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times </i>best-selling memoir from John le Carré, the legendary author of <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Night Manager</i>, now an Emmy-nominated television series starring Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie.</p> <p>From his years serving in British Intelligence during the Cold War, to a career as a writer that took him from war-torn Cambodia to Beirut on the cusp of the 1982 Israeli invasion to Russia before and after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, le Carré&nbsp;has always written from the heart of modern times.&nbsp;In this, his first memoir,&nbsp;le Carré is as funny as he is incisive, reading into the events he witnesses the same moral ambiguity with which he imbues his novels.</p> <p>Whether he's writing about the parrot at a Beirut hotel that could perfectly mimic machine gun fire or the opening bars of Beethoven’s Fifth; visiting Rwanda’s museums of the unburied dead in the aftermath of the genocide; celebrating New Year’s Eve 1982 with Yasser Arafat and his high command; interviewing a German woman terrorist in her desert prison in the Negev; listening to the wisdoms of the great physicist, dissident, and Nobel Prize winner Andrei Sakharov; meeting with two former heads of the KGB; watching Alec Guinness prepare for his role as George Smiley in the legendary BBC TV adaptations of&nbsp;<i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>&nbsp;and <i>Smiley’s People</i>; or describing the female aid worker who inspired the main character in&nbsp;<i>The Constant Gardener</i>, le Carré endows each happening with vividness and humor, now making us laugh out loud, now inviting us to think anew about events and people we believed we understood.</p> <p>Best of all, le Carré gives us a glimpse of a writer’s journey over more than six decades, and his own hunt for the human spark that has given so much life and heart to his fictional characters.</p>";
