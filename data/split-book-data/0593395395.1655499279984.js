window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Spanning millennia and continents, here is a stunningly revealing history of how the distribution of water has shaped human civilization. Boccaletti, of The Nature Conservancy, “tackles the most important story of our time: our relationship with water in a world of looming scarcity” (Kelly McEvers, NPR host).</b></p> <p>Writing with authority and brio, Giulio Boc­caletti - honorary research associate at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, Univer­sity of Oxford - shrewdly combines environmental and social history, beginning with the earliest civ­ilizations of sedentary farmers on the banks of the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates Rivers. Even as he describes how these societies were made possible by sea-level changes from the last glacial melt, he incisively examines how this type of farming led to irrigation and multiple cropping, which, in turn, led to a population explosion and labor specialization.&nbsp;</p> <p>We see with clarity how irrigation’s structure informed social structure (inventions such as the calendar sprung from agricultural necessity); how in ancient Greece, the communal ownership of wells laid the groundwork for democracy; how the Greek and Roman experiences with water security resulted in systems of taxation; and how the modern world as we know it began with a legal framework for the development of water infrastructure.&nbsp;</p> <p>Extraordinary for its monumental scope and piercing insightfulness, <i>Water: A Biography </i>richly enlarges our understanding of our relationship to - and fundamental reliance on - the most elemental substance on Earth.</p> <p><i>Cover image: \"Vista\", painting by Tobias Tovera&nbsp;© 2016</i></p>";
