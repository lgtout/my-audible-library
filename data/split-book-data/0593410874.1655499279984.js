window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The award-winning, #1 internationally bestselling new novel by the author of </b><b><i>The Perfect Nanny </i></b><b>that “lays bare women’s intimate, lacerating experience of war” (</b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>After World War II, Mathilde leaves France for Morocco to be with her husband, whom she met while he was fighting for the French army. A spirited young woman, she now finds herself a farmer’s wife, her vitality sapped by the isolation, the harsh climate, and the mistrust she inspires as a foreigner. But she refuses to be subjugated or confined to her role as mother of a growing family. As tensions mount between the Moroccans and the French colonists, Mathilde’s fierce desire for autonomy parallels her adopted country’s fight for independence in this lush and transporting novel about race, resilience, and women’s empowerment.</p>";
