window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Whitewashing of Christianity </i>is informative, insightful, and inspirational, telling a history that's often hidden, ignored, revised, or unknown. Confrontational, but not combative, it details how the American church has helped create and maintain the false narrative that Christianity is a White man's religion and how it has presented almost every person in Scripture and most of Africa's theologians and martyrs as White men and women. You will be given countless references that chronicle what whitewashing is, how it has been maintained, the negative effects it has caused, and more importantly, how we can stop it.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Whitewashing of Christianity</i>:</p> <ul> <li>Takes you on a historical, sociological, judicial, and religious journey of how Christianity has been whitewashed</li> <li>Addresses the negative effects of whitewashing and how many view Christianity as a religion of oppression</li> <li>Presents a full narrative of redemptive history, which finds it roots in Africa</li> <li>Highlights African theologians, philosophers, teachers, and martyrs</li> <li>Addresses claims from those that oppose Christianity with sources, Scripture, and historical facts</li> <li>Equips people on how to engage inaccurate claims of Christian history and slavery</li> <li>Addresses the concerns of those that think Christianity is not an indigenous faith of people of African descent</li> <li>Equips churches and organizations with ways to combat whitewashing and move in unity</li> </ul> <p><i>The Whitewashing of Christianity</i> leaves us with hope that what's been done historically can be changed. It is compelling, not combative and written from a place of love and desire to fight for presenting Christianity in a diverse way and not a culturally monolithic one. Gay challenges popular views that are historically unfounded and issues a challenge that needs to take place within the Christian church. While challenging and eye-opening, you'll be made aware of a hidden past of accomplishments and contributions of Africa, confronted with a hurtful present of whitewashing effects.</p>";
