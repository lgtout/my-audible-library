window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“A madcap adventure...Adams’s writing teeters on the fringe of inspired lunacy.” (<i>United Press International</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>Back on Earth with nothing more to show for his long, strange trip through time and space than a ratty towel and a plastic shopping bag, Arthur Dent is ready to believe that the past eight years were all just a figment of his stressed-out imagination. But a gift-wrapped fishbowl with a cryptic inscription, the mysterious disappearance of Earth's dolphins, and the discovery of his battered copy of <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> all conspire to give Arthur the sneaking suspicion that something otherworldly is indeed going on.&nbsp;</p> <p>God only knows what it all means. Fortunately, He left behind a Final Message of explanation. But since it's light-years away from Earth, on a star surrounded by souvenir booths, finding out what it is will mean hitching a ride to the far reaches of space aboard a UFO with a giant robot. But what else is new?&nbsp;</p> <p>“The most ridiculously exaggerated situation comedy known to created beings.... Adams is irresistible.” (<i>The Boston Globe</i>)</p>";
