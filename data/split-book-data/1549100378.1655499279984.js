window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The definitive guide to statistical thinking</b></p> <p>Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence - and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders.</p> <p>In <i>The Art of Statistics</i>, world-renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows listeners how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the <i>Titanic</i>, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. <i>The Art of Statistics</i> not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems - it teaches us how we, too, can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and - perhaps even more importantly - we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive.</p> <p>Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, <i>The Art of Statistics</i> is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
