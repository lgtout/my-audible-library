window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Pain, suffering, and stress can be intolerable, but it doesn't have to be this way. <i>You Are Not Your Pain</i> reveals a simple set of mindfulness-based practices that you can incorporate into your daily life to relieve chronic pain and the suffering and stress of illness. Clinical trials show that mindfulness meditation can be as effective as prescription painkillers and can enhance the body's natural healing systems, while also significantly reducing anxiety, depression, irritability, exhaustion, and insomnia - all symptoms that can arise from chronic pain and illness.&nbsp;</p> <p>Developed by two authors who themselves have struggled with severe pain due to serious injuries, this accessible book reveals the eight-week program that will quickly melt away your suffering and help you cope with your pain. Taking up just 10-20 minutes per day, this is a simple yet effective way to soothe some of the common causes of pain like back problems, arthritis, migraine, and diabetes, but can also be effective for people undergoing chemotherapy, people with heart disease, fibromyalgia, celiac disease, and much more. Listeners will be able to identify and focus on secondary suffering which is brought about when the mind becomes fixated on the anxiety of pain, and begins to anticipate it, thereby making suffering worse. Using the meditations and techniques within the book, listeners will learn to breathe in to their pain and dissolve suffering by soothing the brain's pain networks and leaving you able to live life fully again.&nbsp;</p> <p>For further information, videos, and guides, please visit: www.breathworks-mindfulness.org.uk/mindfulness-for-health-extra-materials&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
