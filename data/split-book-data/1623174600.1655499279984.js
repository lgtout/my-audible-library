window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Françoise Bourzat has written an authoritative book on guided psychedelic therapy with important lessons for anyone thinking of either guiding or being guided.” (Michael&nbsp;Pollan&nbsp;via Twitter)</b></p> <p><b>A comprehensive guide to the safe and ethical application of expanded states of consciousness for therapists, healing practitioners, and sincere explorers</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Psychedelic medicines also known as entheogens are entering the mainstream. And it’s no wonder: despite having access to the latest wellness trends and advances in technology, we’re no healthier, happier, or more meaningfully connected. Psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca, and LSD - as well as other time-tested techniques with the power to shift consciousness such as drumming, meditation, and vision quests - are now being recognized as potent catalysts for change and healing. But how do we ensure that we’re approaching them effectively?&nbsp;</p> <p>Françoise Bourzat - a counselor and experienced guide with sanctioned training in the Mazatec and other indigenous traditions - and healer Kristina Hunter introduce a holistic model focusing on the threefold process of preparation, journey, and integration. Drawing from more than 30 years of experience, Bourzat’s skillful and heartfelt approach presents the therapeutic application of expanded states, without divorcing them from their traditional contexts.&nbsp;<i>Consciousness Medicine&nbsp;</i>delivers a coherent map for navigating nonordinary states of consciousness, offering an invaluable contribution to the field of healing and transformation.</p>";
