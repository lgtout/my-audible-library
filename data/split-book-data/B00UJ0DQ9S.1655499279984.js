window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Conventional wisdom holds that America has been a Christian nation since the Founding Fathers. But in <i>One Nation Under God</i>, historian Kevin M. Kruse argues that the idea of \"Christian America\" is nothing more than a myth - and a relatively recent one at that. </p> <p>The assumption that America was, is, and always will be a Christian nation dates back no further than the 1930s, when a coalition of businessmen and religious leaders united in opposition to FDR's New Deal. With the full support of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, these activists - the forerunners of the Religious Right - propelled religion into the public sphere. Church membership skyrocketed; Congress added the phrase \"under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance and made \"In God We Trust\" the country's official motto. For the first time, America became a thoroughly religious nation. </p> <p>Provocative and authoritative, <i>One Nation Under God</i> reveals how the comingling of money, religion, and politics created a false origin story that continues to define and divide American politics today.</p>";
