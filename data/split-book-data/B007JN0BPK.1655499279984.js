window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Lucid dreaming: it's when you suddenly realize that you are dreaming... and then sustain that wide-awake clarity while in a dream state. For millenia, it's been used by ordinary people and advanced meditators for practical insights, self-discovery, and delving into the architecture of reality itself. Here, the pioneer of scientific lucid-dream research offers two guided sessions, one to play in the daytime and one to play at night before sleep. These are the same conditoning programs used to help and train hundreds of \"oneironauts\" (volunteer lucid-dream subjects) at Stanford University and the Lucidity Institute.</p>";
