window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In an irresistible invitation to lighten up, look around, and live an unscripted life, a Stanford University professor and master of the art of improvisation explains how to adopt the attitudes and techniques used by generations of musicians and actors. These secrets are currently being taught to entrepreneurs, engineers, and first responders in a crisis as well as housewives and Alzheimer caregivers. </p> <p>Let's face it: Life is something we all make up as we go along. No matter how carefully we formulate a \"script\", it is bound to change when we interact with people with scripts of their own. <i>Improv Wisdom</i> shows how to apply the maxims of improvisational theater to real-life challenges - whether it's dealing with a demanding boss, a tired child, or one of life's never-ending surprises. Patricia Ryan Madson distills 30 years of experience into thirteen simple strategies, including \"Say Yes\", \"Start Anywhere\", \"Face the Facts\", and \"Make Mistakes, Please\", helping readers to loosen up, think on their feet, and take on everything life has to offer with skill, chutzpah, and a sense of humor.</p>";
