window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A prize-winning journalist with a background in neuroscience, Helen Thomson spent years tracking down people who live with the world's most extraordinary neurological disorders - like a man who tried to break his back because his legs no longer felt like his own, and another who believed that he was dead for nine years. Not content to simply read about these cases on paper, Thomson&nbsp;reached out to 10 people with these afflictions, and they agreed to tell her their stories.</p> <p>Leaving behind the scans and the clinical histories, <i>Unthinkable&nbsp;</i>ties&nbsp;the first-ever interviews with the people who&nbsp;have these rare conditions together with cutting-edge science. Through these incredible tales, Thomson casts a light on the chaos that the human mind can create. She shows us how these strange conditions hold the keys to unlocking the biggest mysteries of the human brain, and provide a deeper understanding of the human condition itself.</p> <p>Combining careful observation with bold science and vibrant storytelling, <i>Unthinkable </i>takes us on a deep dive into the weirdest corners of our brain, and helps us to see our own creativity, our emotions, and our consciousness more clearly.</p>";
