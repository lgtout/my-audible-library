This is the \"intelligence trap\", the subject of David Robson's fascinating and provocative book.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Intelligence Trap</i> explores cutting-edge ideas in our understanding of intelligence and expertise, including \"strategic ignorance\", \"meta-forgetfulness\", and \"functional stupidity.\" Robson reveals the surprising ways that even the brightest minds and most talented organizations can go wrong - from some of Thomas Edison's worst ideas to failures at NASA, Nokia, and the FBI. And he offers practical advice to avoid mistakes based on the timeless lessons of Benjamin Franklin, Richard Feynman, and Daniel Kahneman.</p>";
