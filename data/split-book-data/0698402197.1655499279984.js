window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We are living in a time of unprecedented distrust in America.... Faith in the government is at an all-time low, and political groups on both sides of the aisle are able to tout preposterous conspiracy theories as gospel, without much opposition. “Fake news” is the order of the day. This book is about a man to whom all of it points, the greatest conspiracist of this generation and a man you may not have heard of.&nbsp;</p> <p>A former US naval intelligence worker, Milton William Cooper published his manifesto <i>Behold a Pale Horse</i> in 1991. Since then it has gone on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, becoming the number-one best seller in the American prison system. According to <i>Behold a Pale Horse</i>, JFK was assassinated - because he was about to reveal that extraterrestrials were about to take over the earth - by his driver, an alien himself; AIDS is a government conspiracy to decrease the population of Blacks, Hispanics, and homosexuals; and the Illuminati are secretly involved with the US government to manage relationships with extraterrestrials. Cooper died in a shootout with Apache County police in 2001, one month after September 11, in the year in which he had predicted catastrophe.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Pale Horse Rider</i>, journalist Mark Jacobson not only tells the story of Cooper’s fascinating life but also provides the social and political context for American paranoia. Indeed, with the present NSA situation and countless other shadowy government dealings often in the news, aren’t we right to suspect that things may not be as they seem?</p>";
