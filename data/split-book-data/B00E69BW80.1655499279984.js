window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Alexander Litvinenko set out for London's Millennium Hotel one November day in 2006, he already knew he was embroiled in a political conflict. The dissident Russian agent had, after all, fled Moscow to escape the wrath of Vladimir Putin and the country's feared security service. </p> <p>What he didn't realise was that the men he would drink with that afternoon were about to throw him into another battle: a brutal fight with a little-known but devastatingly toxic poison. </p> <p>More than six years after a fatal poisoning that made headlines around the world, award-winning novelist and investigative journalist Will Storr navigates the web of betrayal and biology that left Litvinenko dead. Edited by Pulitzer prize-winning science writer Deborah Blum, the sixth story from MATTER delves into the history of Russia's poisoning programme - and the extraordinary properties of what may be it most deadly product. </p>";
