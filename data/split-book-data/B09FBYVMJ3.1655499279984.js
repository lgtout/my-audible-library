window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A delightful intellectual feast from the best-selling author of </b><b><i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Order of Time</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>One of the world’s most prominent physicists and fearless free spirit, Carlo Rovelli is also a masterful storyteller. His best-selling books have introduced millions of people to the wonders of modern physics and his singular perspective on the cosmos. This new collection of essays reveals a curious intellect always on the move. Rovelli invites us on an accessible and enlightening voyage through science, literature, philosophy, and politics.</p> <p>Written with his usual clarity and wit, this journey ranges widely across time and space: from Newton's alchemy to Einstein's mistakes, from Nabokov’s lepidopterology to Dante’s cosmology, from mind-altering psychedelic substances to the meaning of atheism, from the future of physics to the power of uncertainty. Charming, pithy, and elegant, this book is the perfect gateway to the universe of one of the most influential minds of our age.</p>";
