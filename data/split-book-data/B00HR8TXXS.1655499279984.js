window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Sane Society</i> is a continuation and extension of the brilliant psychiatric concepts Erich Fromm first formulated in <i>Escape from Freedom</i>; it is also, in many ways, an answer to Freud’s <i>Civilization and its Discontents.</i> Fromm examines man’s escape into over conformity and the danger of robotism in contemporary industrial society: Modern humanity has, he maintains, been alienated from the world of their own creation. Here Fromm offers a complete and systematic exploration of his “humanistic psychoanalysis.” In so doing, he counters the profound pessimism for our future that Freud expressed and sets forth the goals of a society in which the emphasis is on each person and on the social measures designed to further function as a responsible individual. </p>";
