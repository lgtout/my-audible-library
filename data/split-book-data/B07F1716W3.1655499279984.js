window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Like most people, you probably wake up, get hungry for meals and doze off in bed around the same time every day. If you've ever experienced jet lag or pulled an all-nighter, you know that this schedule can easily be thrown off kilter. But for some people, that imbalance or difficulty sleeping at night, hunger at odd times, or sudden fatigue at noon is a constant. If you're one of those people, Dr. Satchin Panda, one of the leading researchers on circadian rhythms, has a plan to reset your body clock.&nbsp;</p> <p>Beginning with an in-depth explanation of the circadian clock - why it's important, how it works, and how to know it isn't working - <i>The Circadian Code</i> outlines lifestyle changes to make to get back on track. It's a concrete plan to enhance weight loss, improve sleep, optimize exercise, and manage technology so that it doesn't interfere with your body's natural rhythm. Dr. Panda's life changing methods show you how to prevent and reverse ailments like diabetes, cancer, and dementia, as well as microbiome conditions like acid reflux, heartburn, and irritable bowel disease.</p>";
