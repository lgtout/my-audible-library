window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Is this really how I want to live my life? </p> <p>Each one of us at some point asks this question. The tragedy is not that life is short, but that we often see only in hindsight what really matters. </p> <p>In what was her first book on life and living, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross joined with David Kessler to guide listeners through the practical and spiritual lessons we need to learn so that we can live life to its fullest in every moment. Many years of working with the dying showed the authors that certain lessons come up over and over again. Some of these lessons are enormously difficult to master but even the attempts to understand them can be deeply rewarding. Here, in 14 accessible chapters, from the \"Lesson of Love\" to the \"Lesson of Happiness\", the authors reveal the truth about our fears, our hopes, our relationships, and above all, about the grandness of who we really are.</p>";
