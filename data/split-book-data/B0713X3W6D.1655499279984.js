window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The great modern classic of a brilliant rebel's personal exploration into the nature of consciousness. </p> <p>\"<i>Cosmic Trigger</i> deals with a process of deliberately induced brain change. This process is called 'initiation' or 'vision quest' in many traditional societies and can loosely be considered some dangerous variety of self-psychotherapy in modern terminology. I do not recommend it for everybody...briefly, the main thing I learned in my experiments is that 'reality' is always plural and mutable.\" (Robert Anton Wilson, from the preface) </p> <p>Narration by Oliver Senton, \"Robert Anton Wilson\" in Daisy Eris Campbell's stage production of Cosmic Trigger. </p> <p>Based on The Robert Anton Wilson Trust Authorized Hilaritas Press Edition. </p> <p>Published by Hilaritas Press. </p>";
