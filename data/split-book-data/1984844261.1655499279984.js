window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller</b></p> <p><b>In her latest book, Brené Brown writes, “If we want to find the way back to ourselves and one another, we need language and the grounded confidence to both tell our stories and to be stewards of the stories that we hear. This is the framework for meaningful connection.”</b></p> <p>In <i>Atlas of the Heart</i>, Brown takes us on a journey through 87 of the emotions and experiences that define what it means to be human. As she maps the necessary skills and an actionable framework for meaningful connection, she gives us the language and tools to access a universe of new choices and second chances - a universe where we can share and steward the stories of our bravest and most heartbreaking moments with one another in a way that builds connection.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, Brown’s extensive research into the experiences that make us who we are has shaped the cultural conversation and helped define what it means to be courageous with our lives. <i>Atlas of the Heart </i>draws on this research, as well as on Brown’s singular skills as a storyteller, to&nbsp;show us how accurately naming an experience doesn’t give the experience more power, it gives <i>us</i> the power of understanding, meaning, and choice.</p> <p>Brown shares, “I want this book to be an atlas for all of us, because I believe that, with an adventurous heart and the right maps, we can travel anywhere and never fear losing ourselves.”</p> <p><b>Includes a downloadable PDF of illustrations from the book</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
