window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Andy Couturier captures the texture of sustainable lives well lived in these 10 profiles of ordinary - yet exceptional - men and women who left behind mainstream existences in urban Japan to live surrounded by the luxuries of nature, art, friends, delicious food, and an abundance of time.&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing on traditional Eastern spiritual wisdom and culture, these pioneers describe the profound personal transformations they underwent as they escaped the stress, consumerism, busyness, and dependence on technology of modern life. This intimate and evocative book tells of their fulfilling lives as artists, philosophers, and farmers who rely on themselves for happiness and sustenance. By inviting readers to enter into the essence of these individuals’ days, Couturier shows us how we, too, can bring more meaning and richness to our own lives.</p>";
