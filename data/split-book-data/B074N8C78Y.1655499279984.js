window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This book could save your life: Protect yourself from violence and learn survival skills for dangerous situations with this essential guide from a former military intelligence officer.</p> <p>In a civilized society, violence is rarely the answer. But when it is - it's the only answer.&nbsp;</p> <p>The sound of breaking glass downstairs in the middle of the night.&nbsp;</p> <p>The words \"move and you die\".&nbsp;</p> <p>The hands on your child, or the knife to your throat.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this essential new book, self-protection expert and former military intelligence officer Tim Larkin changes the way we think about violence in order to save our lives. By deconstructing our assumptions about violence - its morality, its function in modern society, how it actually works - Larkin unlocks the shackles of our own taboos and arms us with what we need to know to prevent, prepare for, and survive the unthinkable event of life-or-death violence. Through a series of harrowing true-life stories, Larkin demonstrates that violence is a tool equally effective in the hands of the \"bad guy\" or the \"good guy\"; that the person who acts first, fastest, and with the full force of their body is the one who survives; and that each and every one of us is capable of being that person when our lives are at stake.&nbsp;</p> <p>An indispensable resource, <i>When Violence Is the Answer</i> will remain with you long after you've finished listening, as the bedrock of your self-protection skills and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>";
