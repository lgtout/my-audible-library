window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Ecce homo</i>, \"behold the man\", are the words Friedrich Nietzsche chose as the title for his literary self-portrait. A main purpose of the book was to offer Nietzsche's own perspective on his work as a philosopher and human being. <p><i>Ecce Homo</i> also forcefully repudiates those interpretations of his previous works purporting to find support there for imperialism, anti-Semitism, militarism, and Social Darwinism.</p> <p>Nietzsche strives to present a new image of the philosopher and of himself as a philosopher. He expounds upon his life as a child, his tastes as an individual, and his vision for humanity. On these grounds, some consider <i>Ecce Homo</i> a literary work comparable in its artistry to Van Gogh's paintings.</p>";
