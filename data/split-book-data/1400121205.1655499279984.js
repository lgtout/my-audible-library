window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From a giant of health care policy, an engaging and enlightening account of why American health care is so expensive - and why it doesn't have to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Uwe Reinhardt was a towering figure and moral conscience of health care policy in the United States and beyond. Famously bipartisan, he advised presidents and Congress on health reform and originated central features of the Affordable Care Act. In <i>Priced Out</i>, Reinhardt offers an engaging and enlightening account of today's US health care system, explaining why it costs so much more and delivers so much less than the systems of every other advanced country, why this situation is morally indefensible, and how we might improve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The problem, Reinhardt says, is not one of economics but of social ethics. There is no American political consensus on a fundamental question other countries settled long ago: To what extent should we be our brothers' and sisters' keepers when it comes to health care?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>An incisive look at the American health care system, <i>Priced Out</i> dispels the confusion, ignorance, myths, and misinformation that hinder effective reform.</p>";
