Not to be missed by anyone who wants to understand how ideas change the world.” (Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize and author of </b><b><i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p>What do James Bond and Lipitor have in common? What can we learn about human nature and world history from a glass of water?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Loonshots</i>, physicist and entrepreneur Safi Bahcall reveals a surprising new way of thinking about the mysteries of group behavior that challenges everything we thought we knew about nurturing radical breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing on the science of phase transitions, Bahcall reveals why teams, companies, or any group with a mission will suddenly change from embracing wild new ideas to rigidly rejecting them, just as flowing water will suddenly change into brittle ice. Mountains of print have been written about culture. <i>Loonshots </i>identifies the small shifts in structure that control this transition, the same way that temperature controls the change from water to ice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Using examples that range from the spread of fires in forests to the hunt for terrorists online, and stories of thieves and geniuses and kings, Bahcall reveals how this new kind of science helps us understand the behavior of companies and the fate of empires. <i>Loonshots </i>distills these insights into lessons for creatives, entrepreneurs, and visionaries everywhere.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the past decade, researchers have been applying the tools and techniques of phase transitions to understand how birds flock, fish swim, brains work, people vote, criminals behave, ideas spread, diseases erupt, and ecosystems collapse. If 20th-century science was shaped by the search for fundamental laws, like quantum mechanics and gravity, the 21st will be shaped by this new kind of science. <i>Loonshots </i>is the first to apply these tools to help all of us unlock our potential to create and nurture the crazy ideas that change the world.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
