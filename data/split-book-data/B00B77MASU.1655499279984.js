window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It's a dog eat dog world. Don't be on the menu. </b></p> <p>What are the differences between a winning and losing performance? Why are we able to rise to the challenge one day, but wilt from it the next? Can we in fact become better competitors? In <i>Top Dog,</i> Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman use cutting-edge science to tease out the hidden factors at the core of every great triumph - and every tragic failure. By enabling you to identify your own competitive style, <i>Top Dog</i> will help you tip the odds of success in your favor. Integrating wisdom from politics, finance, genetics, neuroscience, psychology, military training, sports, economics, education and more, <i>Top Dog</i> offers counterintuitive, game-changing insights into the nature of competition, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Why the home-field advantage in sports is just as relevant in diplomacy and deal-making</li> <li>That women are better at judging risk, while men are better at ignoring it - and how this plays out on K Street and Wall Street</li> <li>Why younger siblings are more competitive than first-borns, and how early-childhood influences shape competitive styles forever</li> <li>That the shape of entrepreneurs' hands can be just as revealing as their business plans</li> <li>How a single biochemical can predict a winner before an event has even begun</li> <li>Why discord can be better than harmony, and why stars on a team do deserve special treatment</li> </ul> <p>As President Dwight Eisenhower said, \"What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight - it's the size of the fight in the dog.\" In <i>Top Dog,</i> Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman reveal the size of the fight in all of us.</p>";
