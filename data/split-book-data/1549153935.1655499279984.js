window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This entertaining expos√© on how the other half gets in tells the shockingly true story of the Varsity Blues scandal, and all of the crazy parents, privilege, and con men involved.</b></p> <p><i>Guilty Admissions</i> weaves together the story of an unscrupulous college counselor named Rick Singer, and how he preyed on the desperation of some of the country's wealthiest families living in a world defined by fierce competition, who function under constant pressure to get into the \"right\" schools, starting with preschool; nonstop fundraising and donation demands in the form of multi-million-dollar galas and private parties; and a community of deeply insecure parents who will do anything to get their kids into name-brand colleges in order to maintain their own A-list status.</p> <p>Investigative reporter Nicole LaPorte lays bare the source of this insecurity - that in 2019, no special \"hook\" in the form of legacy status, athletic talent, or financial giving can guarantee a child's entrance into an elite school. The result is paranoia, deception, and true crimes at the peak of the American social pyramid.</p> <p>With a glittering cast of Hollywood actors - including Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin - hedge fund CEOs, sales executives, and media titans, <i>Guilty Admissions</i> is a soap-opera-slash-sneak-peek-behind-the-curtains at America's richest social circles; an examination of the cutthroat world of college admissions; and a parable of American society in 2019, when the country is run by a crass tycoon and all totems of status and achievement have become transactional and removed from traditions of ethical restraint.</p> <p>A world where the rich get whatever they want, however they want it.</p>";
