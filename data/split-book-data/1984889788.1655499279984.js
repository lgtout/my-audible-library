window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A breakthrough work in neuroscience - and an incisive corrective to a long history of damaging pseudoscience - that finally debunks the myth that there is a hardwired distinction between male and female brains.</b></p> <p>We live in a gendered world, where we are ceaselessly bombarded by messages about sex and gender. On a daily basis, we face deeply ingrained beliefs that sex determines our skills and preferences, from toys and colors to career choice and salaries. But what does this constant gendering mean for our thoughts, decisions, and behavior? And what does it mean for our brains?</p> <p>Drawing on her work as a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, Gina Rippon unpacks the stereotypes that surround us from our earliest moments and shows how these messages mold our ideas of ourselves and even shape our brains. By exploring new, cutting-edge neuroscience, Rippon urges us to move beyond a binary view of the brain and to see instead this complex organ as highly individualized, profoundly adaptable, and full of unbounded potential.</p> <p>Rigorous, timely, and liberating, <i>Gender and Our Brains </i>has huge implications for women and men, for parents and children, and for how we identify ourselves.</p>";
