window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An award-winning sociologist reveals the unexpected link between overwork and inequality.</b></p> <p>Most Americans work too long and too hard, while others lack consistency in their hours and schedules. Work hours declined for a century through hard-fought labor-movement victories, but they've increased significantly since the '70s. <i>Worked Over</i> traces the varied reasons why our lives became tethered to a new rhythm of work and describes how we might gain a greater say over our labor time - and build a more just society in the process.</p> <p>Popular discussions typically focus on overworked professionals.

McCallum demonstrates, from Amazon warehouses to Rust Belt factories to California's gig economy, it's the hours of low-wage workers that are the most volatile and precarious - and the most subject to crises. What's needed is not individual solutions but collective struggle, and throughout <i>Worked Over</i> McCallum recounts the inspiring stories of those battling today's capitalism to win back control of their time.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
