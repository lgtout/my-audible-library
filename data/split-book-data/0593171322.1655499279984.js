window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller! </b></p> <p><b>One of the founders of The Lincoln Project, the best-selling author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Everything Trump Touches Dies</i></b><b>&nbsp;is back with a guidebook for beating Trump’s tricks, traps, and tweets in 2020. </b></p> <p><b>“If you believe America’s future depends on Donald Trump’s political machine being crushed at the polls next year, then Rick Wilson’s&nbsp;</b><b><i>Running Against the Devil</i></b><b>&nbsp;is a must-read.” (Joe Scarborough, MSNBC) </b></p> <p>Donald Trump is exactly the disaster we feared for America. Hated by a majority of Americans, Trump’s administration is rocked by daily scandals, and he’s embarrassed us at home and abroad.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump&nbsp;<i>can’t</i>&nbsp;win in 2020, right?&nbsp;</p> <p>Wrong. As 2016 proved, Trump can’t&nbsp;<i>win</i>,&nbsp;but the Democrats can sure as&nbsp;<i>hell</i>&nbsp;lose. Only one thing can save Trump, and that’s a Democratic candidate who runs the race&nbsp;<i>Trump</i>&nbsp;wants them to run instead of the campaign they&nbsp;<i>must&nbsp;</i>run to win in 2020.&nbsp;</p> <p>Wilson combines decades of national political experience and insight in his take-no-prisoners analysis, hammering Trump’s destructive and dangerous first term in a case-by-case takedown of the worst president in history and describing the terrifying prospect of four more years of Trump.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like no one else can, Wilson blows the lid off Trump’s 2020 Republican war machine, showing the exact strategies and tactics they’ll use against the Democratic nominee...and how the Democrats can avoid the catastrophe waiting for them if they fall into Trump’s trap.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Running</i> <i>Against the Devil</i>&nbsp;is sharply funny, brutally honest, and infused with WIlson's biting commentary. It’s a vital indictment of Trump, a no-nonsense, no-holds-barred road map to saving America, and&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>guide to making Donald Trump a one-term president.&nbsp;</p> <p>The stakes are too high to do anything less.</p>";
