window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You don't have to do a dangerous job to endure a health-destroying, possibly life-threatening workplace.</p> <p>Just ask the manager in a senior finance role whose immense workload required frequent all-nighters, leading to alcohol and drug addiction. Or the dedicated news media producer whose commitment to getting the story resulted in a 60-pound weight gain thanks to having no down time to eat properly or exercise. These individuals are not exceptions.</p> <p>Every industry is filled with them, and the costs, to both employees and their companies, is enormous.</p> <p>In <i>Dying for a Paycheck</i>, Jeffrey Pfeffer reveals that the management practices that literally sicken and sometimes kill employees do not enhance productivity or the bottom line. Instead, they diminish employee engagement, increase turnover, reduce job performance, and drive up health costs.</p> <p>Offering guidance and practical solutions for enhancing workplace wellbeing, <i>Dying for a Paycheck</i> is a clarion call for a social movement focused on human sustainability.</p>";
