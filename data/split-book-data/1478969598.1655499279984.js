window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A brilliant and insightful exploration of the rise and fall of the American middle class by </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author Barbara Ehrenreich. One of Barbara Ehrenreich's most classic and prophetic works, </b><b><i>Fear of Falling</i></b><b> closely examines the insecurities of the American middle class in an attempt to explain its turn to the right during the last two decades of the 20th century.</b></p> <p>Weaving finely-tuned expert analysis with her trademark voice, Ehrenreich traces the myths about the middle class to their roots, determines what led to the shrinking of what was once a healthy percentage of the population, and how, in its ambition and anxiety, that population has retreated from responsible leadership.</p> <p>Newly reissued and timely as ever, <i>Fear of Falling </i>places the middle class of yesterday under the microscope and reveals exactly how we arrived at the middle class of today.</p>";
