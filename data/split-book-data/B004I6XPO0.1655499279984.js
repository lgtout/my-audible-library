window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and Named One of the Ten Best Books of the Year by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. </p> <p>Almost a decade in the making, this much-anticipated grand history of postwar Europe from one of the world’s most esteemed historians and intellectuals is a singular achievement. <i>Postwar</i> is the first modern history that covers all of Europe, both east and west, drawing on research in six languages to sweep listeners through 34 nations and 60 years of political and cultural change—all in one integrated, enthralling narrative. Both intellectually ambitious and compelling to read, thrilling in its scope and delightful in its small details, <i>Postwar</i> is a rare joy. </p> <p>Tony Judt (1948–2010), the author of 11 books, was Erich Maria Remarque professor of European studies at New York University and director and founder of the Remarque Institute.</p>";
