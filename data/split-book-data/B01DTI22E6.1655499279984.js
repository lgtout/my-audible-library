window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Meditation: It's not just a way to relax, or to deal with life's problems. Done correctly, it can be a way to radically encounter bliss and to begin - and sustain - real transformation in ourselves. </p> <p>In <i>Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond</i>, self-described meditation junkie Ajahn Brahm shares his knowledge and experience of the jhanas - a core part of the Buddha's original meditation teaching. Never before has this material been approached in such an empowering way, by a teacher of such authority and popularity. </p> <p>Full of surprises, delightfully goofy humor, and entertaining stories that inspire, instruct, and illuminate, <i>Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond</i> will encourage those new to meditation, and give a shot in the arm to more experienced practitioners as well. </p>";
