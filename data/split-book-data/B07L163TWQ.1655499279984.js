window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A provocative, exciting, and important rallying cry to reassert our human spirit of community and teamwork.\" (Walter Isaacson)</b></p> <p>Though created by humans, our technologies, markets, and institutions often contain an antihuman agenda. Douglas Rushkoff, digital theorist and host of the NPR-One podcast <i>Team Human</i>, reveals the dynamics of this antihuman machinery and invites us to remake these aspects of society in ways that foster our humanity.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 100 aphoristic statements, his manifesto exposes how forces for human connection have turned into ones of isolation and repression: Money, for example, has transformed from a means of exchange to a means of exploitation, and education has become an extension of occupational training. Digital-age technologies have only amplified these trends, presenting the greatest challenges yet to our collective autonomy: robots taking our jobs, algorithms directing our attention, and social media undermining our democracy. But all is not lost.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's time for<i> Team Human</i> to take a stand, regenerate the social bonds that define us and, together, make a positive impact on this earth.</p>";
