window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Consciousness creates all material reality. Biological processes do not create consciousness. This conceptual breakthrough turns traditional scientific thinking upside down. In <i>An End to Upside Down Thinking</i>, Mark Gober traces his journey - he explores compelling scientific evidence from a diverse set of disciplines, ranging from psychic phenomena to near-death experiences to quantum physics and beyond. With cutting-edge thinkers like two-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr. Ervin Laszlo, chief scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences Dr. Dean Radin, and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Larry Dossey, MD, supporting this thesis, this book will rock the scientific community and mainstream generalists interested in understanding the true nature of reality.&nbsp;</p> <p>Today's disarray around the globe can be linked, at its core, to a fundamental misunderstanding of our reality. This book aims to shift our collective outlook, reshaping our view of human potential and how we treat one another. The book's implications encourage much-needed revisions in science, technology, and medicine. General listeners will find comfort in the implied worldview, which will impact their happiness and everyday decisions related to business, health, and politics.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i> meets Eckhart Tolle's <i>The Power of Now</i>.</p>";
