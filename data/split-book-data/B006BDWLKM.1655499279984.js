window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Yellow Fever Black Goddess</i>, popular author and biology professor, Christopher Wills, brings the latest scientific developments to the page in entertaining, dramatic form. Through meticulous yet riveting research, he pens a vivid account of deadly microbes struggling for survival in hostile hosts. Beginning with ancient illnesses like the Black Death and syphilis, Christopher Wills explores how these devastating diseases have changed their method of attack through the years. And against the backdrop of more contemporary threats—the spread of AIDS and deadly outbreaks of the Ebola virus—he attempts to answer the compelling question: Will dangerous new plagues sweep the world with death and disfigurement? A remarkable book, <i>Yellow Fever Black Goddess</i> examines headline-making maladies with a balanced approach that respects their powers, yet has faith in the victory of scientific research. Veteran narrator Richard M. Davidson holds listeners spellbound with his thought-provoking rendition.</p>";
