window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Primates of Park Avenue</i>, a bold, timely reconsideration of female infidelity that will upend everything you thought you knew about women and sex.</p> <p>What do straight, married female revelers at an all-women's sex club in LA have in common with nomadic pastoralists in Namibia who bear children by men not their husbands? Like women worldwide, they crave sexual variety, novelty, and excitement.&nbsp;</p> <p>In ancient Greek tragedies, Netflix series, tabloids, and pop songs, we've long portrayed such cheating women as dangerous and damaged. We love to hate women who are untrue. But who are they really? And why, in this age of female empowerment, do we continue to judge them so harshly?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Untrue</i>, feminist author and cultural critic Wednesday Martin takes us on a bold, fascinating journey to reveal the unexpected evolutionary legacy and social realities that drive female faithlessness, while laying bare our motivations to contain women who step out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Blending accessible social science and interviews with sex researchers, anthropologists, and real women from all walks of life, <i>Untrue</i> challenges our deepest assumptions about ourselves, monogamy, and the women we think we know. From recent data suggesting women may struggle more than men with sexual exclusivity to the revolutionary idea that females of many species evolved to be \"promiscuous\" to Martin's trenchant assertion that female sexual autonomy is the ultimate metric of gender equality, <i>Untrue</i> will change the way you think about women and sex forever.&nbsp;</p>";
