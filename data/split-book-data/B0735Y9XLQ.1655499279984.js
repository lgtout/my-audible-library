window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1948 most White people in the North had no idea how unjust and unequal daily life was for the 10 million African Americans living in the South. But that suddenly changed after Ray Sprigle, a famous White journalist from Pittsburgh, went undercover and lived as a Black man in the Jim Crow South.&nbsp;</p> <p>Escorted through the South's parallel Black society by John Wesley Dobbs, a historic Black civil rights pioneer from Atlanta, Sprigle met with sharecroppers, local Black leaders, and families of lynching victims. He visited ramshackle Black schools and slept at the homes of prosperous Black farmers and doctors. The <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> reporter's series was syndicated coast to coast in White newspapers and carried into the South only by the <i>Pittsburgh Courier</i>, the country's leading Black paper. His vivid descriptions and undisguised outrage at \"the iniquitous Jim Crow system\" shocked the North, enraged the South, and ignited the first national debate in the media about ending America's system of apartheid.&nbsp;</p> <p>Six years before <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>, seven before the murder of Emmett Till, and 13 years before John Howard Griffin's similar experiment became the best seller <i>Black Like Me</i>, Sprigle's intrepid journalism blasted into the American consciousness the grim reality of Black lives in the South.&nbsp;</p>";
