Naming names, along with grades and test scores, Golden lays bare a corrupt system in which middle-class and working-class whites and Asian Ameri­cans are routinely passed over in favor of wealthy white students with lesser credentials - children of alumni, big donors, and celebrities. He reveals how a family donation got Jared Kushner into Harvard, and how colleges comply with Title IX by giving scholarships to rich women in “patrician sports” like horseback riding and crew.&nbsp;</p> <p>With a riveting new chapter on Operation Varsity Blues, based on original reporting,&nbsp;<i>The Price of Admission</i>&nbsp;is a must-listen - not only for parents and students with a personal stake in college admissions but also for those disturbed by the growing divide between ordinary and privileged Americans.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Price of Admission </i></b></p> <p>“A disturbing exposé of the influence that wealth and power still exert on admission to the nation’s most prestigious universities.” (<i>The Washington Post</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>“Deserves to become a classic.” (<i>The Economist</i>)</p>";
