window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Unaccountable </i>comes an eye-opening, urgent look at America's broken health care system - and the people who are saving it.&nbsp;</p> <p>One in five Americans now has medical debt in collections and rising health care costs today threaten every small business in America. Dr Makary, one of the nation's leading health care experts, travels across America and details why health care has become a bubble. Drawing from on-the-ground stories, his research and his own experience, <i>The Price We Pay</i> paints a vivid picture of price-gouging, middlemen and a series of elusive money games in need of a serious shake-up. Dr Makary shows how so much of health care spending goes to things that have nothing to do with health and what you can do about it. Dr Makary challenges the medical establishment to remember medicine's noble heritage of caring for people when they are vulnerable.</p> <p><i>The Price We Pay </i>offers a road map for everyday Americans and business leaders to get a better deal on their health care and profiles the disruptors who are innovating medical care. The movement to restore medicine to its mission, Makary argues, is alive and well - a mission that can rebuild the public trust and save our country from the crushing cost of health care.</p> <p></p><p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio on our Desktop Site. </b></p><p></p>";
