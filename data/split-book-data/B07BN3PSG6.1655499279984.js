Passionate pieces that repeatedly assail the inability of many to empathize and to humanize.\" (</b><b><i>Kirkus</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><i>A groundbreaking audiobook from the St. Louis-based journalist often credited with first predicting Donald Trump’s presidential victory.</i></p> <p>In 2015, Sarah Kendzior collected the essays she reported for Al Jazeera and published them as <i>The View from Flyover Country</i>, which became a best seller and garnered praise from readers around the world. Now, <i>The View from Flyover Country</i> is being released with an updated introduction and epilogue that reflect on the ways that the Trump presidency was the certain result of the realities first captured in Kendzior’s essays.</p> <p>A clear-eyed account of the realities of life in America’s overlooked heartland<i>, The View from Flyover Country </i>is a piercing critique of the labor exploitation, race relations, gentrification, media bias, and other aspects of the post-employment economy that gave rise to a president who rules like an autocrat. <i>The View from Flyover Country </i>is necessary listening for anyone who believes that the only way for America to fix its problems is to first discuss them with honesty and compassion.</p>";
