But that’s only the beginning. Knowing that simple acts of kindness transform lives across the globe every day, he sought out these stories and shares some of the best ones here.</p> <p>In <i>HumanKind</i>, you'll meet the mentor who changed a child's life with a single lesson in shoe tying that has had a ripple effect on thousands of lives, the six-year-old whose idea launched a global kindness movement, the band of seamstress grandmas who mend clothes for homeless people, and many other heroes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brad also provides dozens of ways you can make a difference through the simplest words and deeds, showing how each of us has the power to change someone's world as well as our own.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>HumanKind</i> will touch your heart, leaving you grateful for what you have and providing a refuge from the negativity that surrounds us. Listen to one of these stories anytime your spirit needs a lift.</p> <p><i>USA Today </i>best seller</p> <p><i>Wall Street Journal</i> best seller</p> <p>Canadian Book Club Awards Finalist</p>";
