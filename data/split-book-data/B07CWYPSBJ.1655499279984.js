window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>By the author of </b><b><i>Things No One Will Tell Fat Girls</i></b><b> and a heroine of the body image movement, an intimate, gutsy memoir about being a fat woman.</b></p> <p>Jes Baker burst onto the body positivity scene when she created her own ads mocking Abercrombie and Fitch for discriminating against all body types - a move that landed her on the <i>Today</i> show and garnered a loyal following for her raw, honest, and attitude-filled blog missives.</p> <p>Building on the manifesta power of <i>Things</i>, this memoir goes deeply into Jes' inner life, from growing up a fat girl to dating while fat. With material that will have listeners laughing and crying along with Jes' experience, this new book is a natural fit with her irreverent, open-book style.</p> <p>A deeply personal take, <i>Landwhale</i> is a glimpse at life as a fat woman today, but it's also a reflection of the unforgiving ways our culture still treats fatness, all with Jes' biting voice as the guide.</p>";
