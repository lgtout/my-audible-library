window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>The Quantum Universe</i>, Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw approach the world of quantum mechanics in the same way they did in <i>Why Does E=mc2?</i> and make fundamental scientific principles accessible - and fascinating - to everyone.The subatomic realm has a reputation for weirdness, spawning any number of profound misunderstandings, journeys into Eastern mysticism, and woolly pronouncements on the interconnectedness of all things. Cox and Forshaw's contention? There is no need for quantum mechanics to be viewed this way. There is a lot of mileage in the \"weirdness\" of the quantum world, and it often leads to confusion and, frankly, bad science. <i>The Quantum Universe </i>cuts through the Wu Li and asks what observations of the natural world made it necessary, how it was constructed, and why we are confident that, for all its apparent strangeness, it is a good theory.</p> <p>The quantum mechanics of <i>The Quantum Universe</i> provide a concrete model of nature that is comparable in its essence to Newton's laws of motion, Maxwell's theory of electricity and magnetism, and Einstein's theory of relativity.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
