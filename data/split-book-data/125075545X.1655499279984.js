window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A deeply researched warning about how the digital economy threatens</b> <b>artists' lives and work - the music, writing, and visual art that sustain our</b> <b>souls and societies - from an award-winning essayist and critic </b></p> <p>There are two stories you hear about earning a living as an artist in the digital age. One comes from Silicon Valley. There's never been a better time to be an artist, it goes. If you've got a laptop, you've got a recording studio. If you've got an iPhone, you've got a movie camera. And if production is cheap, distribution is free: it's called the Internet. Everyone's an artist; just tap your creativity and put your stuff out there.&nbsp;</p> <p>The other comes from artists themselves. Sure, it goes, you can put your stuff out there, but who's going to pay you for it? Everyone is <i>not</i> an artist. Making art takes years of dedication, and that requires a means of support. If things don't change, a lot of art will cease to be sustainable.&nbsp;</p> <p>So which account is true? Since people are still making a living as artists today, how are they managing to do it? William Deresiewicz, a leading critic of the arts and of contemporary culture, set out to answer those questions. Based on interviews with artists of all kinds, <i>The Death of the Artist</i> argues that we are in the midst of an epochal transformation. If artists were artisans in the Renaissance, bohemians in the 19th century, and professionals in the 20th, a new paradigm is emerging in the digital age, one that is changing our fundamental ideas about the nature of art and the role of the artist in society.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Henry Holt and Company&nbsp;</b></p>";
