window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An award-winning scholar exposes&nbsp;the foundational racism of the child welfare system and calls for radical&nbsp;change&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Many believe the child welfare system protects children from abuse. But as&nbsp;<i>Torn Apart&nbsp;</i>uncovers, this system is designed to punish Black families. Drawing on decades of research, legal scholar and sociologist Dorothy Roberts reveals that the child welfare system is better understood as a “family policing system” that collaborates with law enforcement and prisons to oppress Black communities. Child protection investigations ensnare&nbsp;a majority of&nbsp;Black children,&nbsp;putting&nbsp;their families under intense state surveillance and regulation. Black children are disproportionately likely to be torn from their families and&nbsp;placed&nbsp;in foster care, driving many to juvenile detention and imprisonment.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only way to stop the destruction caused by family policing,&nbsp;<i>Torn Apart&nbsp;</i>argues, is to abolish the child welfare system and liberate Black communities.</p>";
