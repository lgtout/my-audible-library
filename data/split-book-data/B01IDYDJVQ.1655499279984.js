window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The former Confederate states have continually mythologized the South's defeat to the North, depicting the Civil War as unnecessary, or as a fight over states' Constitutional rights, or as a David v. Goliath struggle in which the North waged \"total war\" over an underdog South. In <i>The Myth of the Lost Cause</i>, historian Edward Bonekemper deconstructs this multi-faceted myth, revealing the truth about the war that nearly tore the nation apart 150 years ago. </p>";
