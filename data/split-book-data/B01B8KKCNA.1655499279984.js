window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Attention deficit disorder (ADD) has quickly become a controversial topic in recent years. Whereas other books on the subject describe the condition as inherited, Dr. Gabor Maté believes that our social and emotional environments play a key role in both the cause of and cure for this condition. </p> <p>In <i>Scattered</i>, he describes the painful realities of ADD and its effect on children as well as on career and social paths in adults. While acknowledging that genetics may indeed play a part in predisposing a person toward ADD, Dr. Maté moves beyond that to focus on the things we can control: changes in environment, family dynamics, and parenting choices. He draws heavily on his own experience with the disorder as both an ADD sufferer and the parent of three diagnosed children. </p> <p>Providing a thorough overview of ADD and its treatments, <i>Scattered</i> is an essential and life-changing guide for the millions of ADD sufferers in North America today. </p>";
