window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brought to you by Penguin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meet the traders who supply the world with oil, metal and food - no matter how corrupt, war-torn or famine-stricken the source.</p> <p>The modern world is built on commodities - from the oil that fuels our cars to the metals that power our smartphones.&nbsp;</p> <p>We rarely stop to consider where they come from. But we should.</p> <p>In <i>The World for Sale</i>, two leading journalists lift the lid on one of the least scrutinised corners of the economy: the workings of the billionaire commodity traders who buy, hoard and sell the earth's resources.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is the story of how a handful of swashbuckling businessmen became indispensable cogs in global markets: enabling an enormous expansion in international trade and connecting resource-rich countries - no matter how corrupt or war-torn - with the world's financial centres.</p> <p>And it is the story of how some traders acquired untold political power, right under the noses of Western regulators and politicians - helping Saddam Hussein to sell his oil, fuelling the Libyan rebel army during the Arab Spring and funnelling cash to Vladimir Putin's Kremlin in spite of strict sanctions.</p> <p>The result is an eye-opening tour through the wildest frontiers of the global economy, as well as a revelatory guide to how capitalism really works.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
