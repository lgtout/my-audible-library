window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An entertaining and highly informed guide to what languages are and how they function.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Everyone likes to think they know a bit about language: There are some words that you simply can't translate into English. The origin of a word tells you how it should be used. A dialect is inferior to a language.&nbsp;</p> <p>The problem is, none of these statements are true. In<i> Don't Believe a Word</i>, linguist David Shariatmadari explodes nine common myths about language and introduces us to some of the fundamental insights of modern linguistics. By the end of this eye-opening tour, listeners will understand that grammatical \"errors\" are in fact the foundation of modern English; that the meaning of a word is not what a dictionary says, but how it's used; and that the difference between what gets labeled a \"language\" or \"dialect\" is political, rather than scientific.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Don't Believe a Word</i> offers an accessible and thorough introduction to the science behind one of the most essential aspects of our daily life.</p>";
