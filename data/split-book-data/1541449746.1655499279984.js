window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The American electoral system is clearly falling apart - as evidenced by the 2016 presidential election. In <i>It's Time to Fight Dirty</i>, David Faris offers accessible, actionable strategies for American institutional reform which don't require a constitutional amendment, and would have a lasting impact on our future.</p> <p>With equal amounts of playful irreverence and persuasive reasoning, Faris describes how the Constitution's deep democratic flaws constantly put progressives at a disadvantage, and lays out strategies for \"fighting dirty\" though obstructionism and procedural warfare: establishing statehood for DC and Puerto Rico; breaking California into several states; creating a larger House of Representatives; passing a new voting rights act; and expanding the Supreme Court.</p> <p>The Constitution may be the world's most difficult document to amend, but David Faris argues that many of America's democratic failures can be fixed within its rigid confines - and, at a time when the stakes have never been higher, he outlines a path for long-term, progressive change in the United States.</p>";
