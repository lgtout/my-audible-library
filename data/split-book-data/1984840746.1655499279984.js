That&nbsp;image of the law&nbsp;does not match the reality in the courtroom, however. Much of the time, it is prosecutors more than judges who control the outcome of a case,&nbsp;from choosing the charge to setting bail to determining the plea bargain. They often decide who goes free and who goes to prison, even who lives and who dies. In&nbsp;<i>Charged</i>,&nbsp;Emily Bazelon reveals how&nbsp;this kind of unchecked power&nbsp;is the underreported cause of enormous injustice - and the missing piece in the mass-incarceration puzzle.</p> <p><i>Charged</i>&nbsp;follows the story of two young people caught up in the criminal justice system: Kevin, a 20-year-old in Brooklyn who picked up his friend’s gun as the cops burst in and was charged with a serious violent felony, and Noura, a teenage girl in Memphis indicted for the murder of her mother. Bazelon tracks both cases - from arrest and charging to trial and sentencing - and with her trademark blend of deeply reported narrative, legal analysis, and investigative journalism illustrates just how criminal prosecutions can go wrong and, more important, why they don’t have to.</p> <p>Bazelon&nbsp;also&nbsp;details&nbsp;the second chances&nbsp;they&nbsp;prosecutors&nbsp;can extend, if they choose, to Kevin and Noura and so many others.&nbsp;She follows a wave of reform-minded DAs who have been elected in some of our biggest cities, as well as in rural areas in every region of the country, put in office to do nothing less than reinvent how their job is done. If they succeed, they can point the country toward a different and profoundly better future.</p>";
