window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society has produced the definitive audio recording of Lovecraft's collaboration tales. These are <i>not </i>dramatizations like our Dark Adventure Radio Theatre - rather, this is an audiobook of the stories, in all-new, never-before-heard recordings made by the HPLHS' own Andrew Leman and Sean Branney exclusively for this collection.&nbsp;</p> <p>Working from texts prepared by Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi, this collection features stories HPL wrote with other authors and includes, “The Curse of Yig” (with Zealia Bishop), “The Horror in the Museum”, “The Mound”, “The Night Ocean” (with R.H. Barlow), and many others. &nbsp;All tales include original music by HPLHS composer Troy Sterling Nies. This collection features 33 stories adding up to more than 23 hours of Lovecraftian listening fun, professionally performed and recorded for your enjoyment.</p>";
