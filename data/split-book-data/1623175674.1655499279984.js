window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An essential tool for healers, therapists, activists, and survivors of trauma who are interested in a justice-centered approach to somatic transformation</b></p> <p><i>The Politics of Trauma</i> offers somatics with a social analysis. This book is for therapists and social activists who understand that trauma healing is not just for individuals - and that social change is not just for movement builders. Just as health practitioners need to consider the societal factors underlying trauma, so too must activists understand the physical and mental impacts of trauma on their own lives and the lives of the communities with whom they organize. Trauma healing and social change are, at their best, interdependent. Somatics has proven to be particularly effective in addressing trauma, but in practice it typically focuses solely on the individual, failing to integrate the social conditions that create trauma in the first place. Staci K. Haines, somatic innovator and cofounder of generative somatics, invites listeners to look beyond individual experiences of body and mind to examine the social, political, and economic roots of trauma - including racism, environmental degradation, sexism, and poverty. Haines helps readers identify, understand, and address these sources of trauma to help us bridge individual healing with social transformation.</p>";
