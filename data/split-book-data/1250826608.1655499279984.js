window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>The inspiring, influential senator and best-selling author mixes vivid personal stories with a passionate plea for political transformation.</b></p> <p>Elizabeth Warren is a beacon for everyone who believes that real change can improve the lives of all Americans. Committed, fearless, and famously persistent, she brings her best game to every battle she wages.</p> <p>In <i>Persist</i>, Warren writes about six perspectives that have influenced her life and advocacy. She’s a mother who learned from wrenching personal experience why child care is so essential. She’s a teacher who has known since grade school the value of a good and affordable education. She’s a planner who understands that every complex problem requires a comprehensive response. She’s a fighter who discovered the hard way that nobody gives up power willingly. She’s a learner who thinks, listens, and works to fight racism in America. And she’s a woman who has proven over and over that women are just as capable as men.</p> <p>Candid and compelling, <i>Persist</i> is both a deeply personal audiobook and a powerful call to action. Elizabeth Warren - one of our nation’s most visionary leaders - will inspire everyone to believe that if we’re willing to fight for it, profound change is well within our reach.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Metropolitan Books</b></p>";
