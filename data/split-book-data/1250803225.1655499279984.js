window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"An excellent introduction to behavioral science with relatable examples is presented by an expert narrator.\" - <i>AudioFile Magazine</i> on<i> The Life-Changing Science of Detecting Bullshit</i></b><br><b><br>Expanding upon his viral TEDx Talk, psychology professor and social scientist John V. Petrocelli's <i>The Life-Changing Science of Detecting Bullshit</i> reveals the critical thinking habits you can develop to recognize and combat pervasive false information and delusional thinking that has become a common feature of everyday life.<br></b><br>\"This is the perfect moment for...the psychology of detecting fake news in the world around us—and false beliefs about ourselves too.”<br><b>—Adam Grant</b><br><br><i>Bullshit is the foundation of contaminated thinking and bad decisions that leads to health consequences, financial losses, legal consequences, broken relationships, and wasted time and resources.</i><br><br>No matter how smart we believe ourselves to be, we’re all susceptible to bullshit—and we all engage in it. While we may brush it off as harmless marketing sales speak or as humorous, embellished claims, it’s actually much more dangerous and insidious. It’s how Bernie Madoff successfully swindled billions of dollars from even the most experienced financial experts with his Ponzi scheme. It’s how the protocols of Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward resulted in the deaths of 36 million people from starvation. Presented as truths by authority figures and credentialed experts, bullshit <i>appears</i> legitimate, and we accept their words as gospel. If we don’t question the information we receive from bullshit artists to prove their thoughts and theories, we allow these falsehoods to take root in our memories and beliefs. This faulty data affects our decision making capabilities, sometimes resulting in regrettable life choices. <br><br>But with a little dose of skepticism and a commitment to truth seeking, you can build your critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills to evaluate information, separate fact from fiction, and see through bullshitter spin. In <i>The Life-Changing Science of Detecting Bullshit</i>, experimental social psychologist John V. Petrocelli provides invaluable strategies not only to recognize and protect yourself from everyday bullshit, but to accept your own lack of knowledge about subjects and avoid engaging in bullshit just for societal conformity.<br><br>With real world examples from people versed in bullshit who work in the used car, real estate, wine, and diamond industries, Petrocelli exposes the red-flag warning signs found in the anecdotal stories, emotional language, and buzzwords used by bullshitters that persuade our decisions. By using his critical thinking defensive tactics against those motivated by profit, we will also learn how to stop the toxic misinformation spread from the social media influencers, fake news, and op-eds that permeate our culture and call out bullshit whenever we see it.<br><br><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press<br><br></b>\"This bracing yet accessible work is the right book at the right time. In a world clouded by nonsense, <i>The Life-Changing Science of Detecting Bullshit</i> is a welcome ray of sunshine.”—Daniel H. Pink, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>When, Drive, </i>and <i>To Sell Is Human<br></i><br>“At last, in the form of John Petrocelli’s highly engaging new book, we have straight talk about the doubletalk, flowing sewage-like around us these days. Better still, he walks his talk with scientifically-grounded, actionable information on precisely how to recognize and reject the bilge.” —Robert Cialdini, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</p>";
