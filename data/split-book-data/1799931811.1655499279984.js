window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As insightful and wise today as it was when originally published in France in 1954, Jacques Ellul’s&nbsp;<i>The Technological Society</i>&nbsp;has become a classic in its field, laying the groundwork for all other studies of technology and society that have followed.</p> <p>Ellul offers a penetrating analysis of our technological civilization, showing how technology - which began innocuously enough as a servant of humankind - threatens to overthrow humanity itself in its ongoing creation of an environment that meets its own ends. No conversation about the dangers of technology and its unavoidable effects on society can begin without a careful listening of this book.</p>";
