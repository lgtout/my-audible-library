window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A unique fusion of philosophy and metaphysics set against the backdrop of contemporary culture. Have you ever wondered if the world is really there when you're not looking? We tend to take the reality of our world very much for granted. This book will lead you down the rabbit hole in search of something we can point to, hang our hats on, and say this is real. </p><p>Along the way Jim Baggott presents the important arguments concerning the nature reality as examined by the world's greatest thinkers from the philosophers of ancient Greece to modern scientists and social theorists and takes on materialism, perception, and progress in a refreshingly new and entertaining way.</p>";
