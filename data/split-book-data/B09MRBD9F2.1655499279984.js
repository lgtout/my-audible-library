window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Ponzinomics </i>by Robert L. FitzPatrick, author of <i>False Profits</i>, is the first comprehensive account of how \"multi-level marketing\" was created in America, escaped criminal and civil prosecution, and spread all over the world. It is the first book to fully explain how the legitimate business of \"direct selling\" was turned into pyramid recruiting.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Ponzinomics </i>dissects the elements that distinguish multi-level marketing from legitimate sales, and reveals how a business could become a delusional belief. <i>Ponzinomics </i>reveals how multi-level marketing helped to lay a foundation on Main Street of pervasive deception, financial self-destruction, authoritarian leader-worship, and economic make-believe. <i>Ponzinomics </i>is a discomforting look at the threads of American culture, business, and politics that were woven into what has become the largest scam on Main Street.</p>";
