The relevance of this work is unquestionable, as it leaves us inspired and optimistic that true healing really is possible\" (Sharon Salzberg).&nbsp;</b></p> <p>For four decades, Jon Kabat-Zinn has been teaching the tangible benefits of meditation in the mainstream. Today millions of people have taken up a formal mindfulness meditation practice as part of their everyday lives. But how do you actually go about meditating? What does a formal meditation practice look like? And how can we overcome some of the common obstacles to incorporating meditation into daily life in an age of perpetual self-distraction?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Falling Awake </i>directly answers these urgent and timely questions. Originally published in 2005 as part of a larger book titled<i> Coming to Our Senses</i>, it has been updated with a new foreword by the author and is even more relevant today. Science shows that the tangible benefits of a mindfulness meditation practice are impossible to ignore. Kabat-Zinn explains how to incorporate them into our hectic, modern lives. Listen for a master class from one of the pioneers of the worldwide mindfulness movement.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
