window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How has America become the most unequal advanced country in the world, and what can we do about it? </p> <p>In <i>The Great Divide</i>, Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book <i>The Price of Inequality</i> and suggests ways to counter America's growing problem. With his signature blend of clarity and passion, Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice - the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities. </p> <p>Gathering his writings for popular outlets including <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>, Stiglitz exposes in full America's inequality: its dimensions, its causes, and its consequences for the nation and for the world. From the Reagan era to the Great Recession and its long aftermath, Stiglitz delves into the irresponsible policies - deregulation, tax cuts, and tax breaks for the 1 percent - that are leaving many Americans further and further behind and turning the American dream into an ever more unachievable myth. With formidable yet accessible economic insight, he urges us to embrace real solutions: increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthy; offering more help to the children of the poor; investing in education, science, and infrastructure; helping out homeowners instead of banks; and, most importantly, doing more to restore the economy to full employment. Stiglitz also draws lessons from Scandinavia, Singapore, and Japan, and he argues against the tide of unnecessary, destructive austerity that is sweeping across Europe. </p> <p>Ultimately, Stiglitz believes, our choice is not between growth and fairness; with the right policies, we can choose both. His complaint is not so much about capitalism as such but how 21st-century capitalism has been perverted. His is a call to confront America's economic inequality as the political and moral issue that it is. </p>";
