But it's not. Rather, it's the apex of a certain thought process - a way to imagine the unimaginable and solve the unsolvable. It's the same thought process that enabled Neil Armstrong to take his giant leap for mankind, that allows spacecraft to travel millions of miles through outer space and land on a precise spot, and that brings us closer to colonizing other planets.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fortunately, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to think like one.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this accessible and practical book, Ozan Varol reveals nine simple strategies from rocket science that you can use to make your own giant leaps in work and life - whether it's landing your dream job, accelerating your business, learning a new skill, or creating the next breakthrough product. Today, thinking like a rocket scientist is a necessity. We all encounter complex and unfamiliar problems in our lives. Those who can tackle these problems - without clear guidelines and with the clock ticking - enjoy an extraordinary advantage.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Think Like a Rocket Scientist</i> will inspire you to take your own moonshot and enable you to achieve liftoff.</p>";
