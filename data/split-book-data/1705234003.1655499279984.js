window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Taking America Back for God</i> points to the phenomenon of \"Christian nationalism,\" the belief that the United States is - and should be - a Christian nation. At its heart, Christian nationalism demands that we must preserve a particular kind of social order, an order in which everyone - Christians and non-Christians, native-born and immigrants, whites and minorities, men and women - recognizes their \"proper\" place in society.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first comprehensive empirical analysis of Christian nationalism in the United States, <i>Taking America Back for God</i> illustrates the influence of Christian nationalism on today's most contentious social and political issues. Drawing on multiple sources of national survey data as well as in-depth interviews, Andrew Whitehead and Samuel Perry document how Christian nationalism shapes what Americans think about who they are as a people, what their future should look like, and how they should get there.&nbsp;</p> <p>Americans' stance toward Christian nationalism provides powerful insight into what they think about immigration, Islam, gun control, police shootings, atheists, gender roles, and many other political issues-very much including who they want in the White House. <i>Taking America Back for God</i> is a guide to one of the most important - and least understood - forces shaping American politics.</p>";
