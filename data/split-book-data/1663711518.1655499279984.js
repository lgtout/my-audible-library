window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A revolutionary approach to unlocking your innate ability to achieve success in business and in life</b></p> <p>Why do we constantly feel overwhelmed by stress, dissatisfied in our careers and relationships, and lacking in real purpose? Why do we seem to sabotage ourselves, hampering our productivity and success? The answer lies in our instincts....</p> <p>In every area of life, from business to relationships to health, we act on outdated instincts that were built to help us survive a world ruled by scarcity and danger. But in today's world, those same instincts stop us from succeeding in the environment in which we actually live: a diverse world of abundant choices, and almost limitless connections.</p> <p>Now evolutionary biologist Dr. Rebecca Heiss offers a new approach that harnesses the power of our instincts, and redirects them to work for us rather than against us. Dr. Heiss reveals the science behind our self-sabotaging behaviors, then provides simple, actionable techniques that can rebuild our instinctive minds.</p> <p>Both practical and inspiring, <i>Instinct </i>is a road map that anyone can use to finally stop living on autopilot, improve productivity and happiness, and consciously craft a better life.</p>";
