window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>A historian’s acute take on current American politics </i>&nbsp;</p> <p>“Believe me” may be the most commonly used phrase in Donald Trump’s lexicon. Whether about building a wall or protecting the Christian heritage, the refrain is constant. And to the surprise of many, about 80 percent of white evangelicals <i>have </i>believed Trump - at least enough to help propel him into the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Historian John Fea is not surprised - and in <i>Believe Me </i>he explains how we have arrived at this unprecedented moment in American politics. An evangelical Christian himself, Fea argues that the embrace of Donald Trump is the logical outcome of a long-standing evangelical approach to public life defined by the politics of fear, the pursuit of worldly power, and a nostalgic longing for an American past. In the process, Fea challenges his fellow believers to replace fear with hope, the pursuit of power with humility, and nostalgia with history.&nbsp;</p>";
