window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A captivating first-person look at one of the world's most powerful prosperity dynasties that offers a unique perspective on greed, the Church, and the journey toward Truth.&nbsp;</p> <p>Millions desperate for hope and solutions are enticed by the promise of the prosperity gospel - that God will do whatever they need with just a little faith and a financial gift. All the while, prosperity preachers exploit the poor and the needy to stockpile their riches. What can followers of the true gospel do to combat the deception?</p> <p>Through a remarkable and fascinating journey, Costi Hinn went from a next-generation prosperity preacher to the first to abandon the family faith and share the true gospel. Nephew of the world-famous televangelist Benny Hinn, Costi had a front-row seat to the inner workings and theology of the prosperity gospel. But as Costi's faith deepened, so did his questions about prosperity teaching. As the deceptions in his past were exposed, Costi came face-to-face with the hypocrisy and devastation caused by his belief system and the overwhelming truth about the real Jesus Christ.</p> <p>This captivating look into the daily lives of one of the world's leading prosperity dynasties offers a thoughtful perspective on the perils of greed, the power of the true gospel, and hope for the future of the global church. Through real-life stories, Costi challenges and equips listeners to be living lights pointing the way to the true gospel and the saving grace of Christ.&nbsp;<i>God, Greed, and the (Prosperity) Gospel&nbsp;</i>will bolster your faith and encourage your own journey toward the truth.</p> <p>Spanish edition also available.</p>";
