window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>How can we prepare for an event that is literally beyond anything humanity has ever faced?</b></p> <p><i>Making Contact&nbsp;</i>presents multiple perspectives on what no longer can be denied: UFOs and their occupants are visiting our world. The book answers questions which remain in the wake of the recent Pentagon’s disclosures as to who and why these beings are here.</p> <p>The volume contains original writings by the leading experts of the phenomena such as:&nbsp;Linda Moulton Howe, Earthfiles reporter;&nbsp;Whitley Strieber, best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>Communion</i>;&nbsp;Professor John E. Mack, former head of the Harvard Medical school of psychiatry and an alien abduction investigator;&nbsp;Darryl Anka,&nbsp;internationally known for his communication with the extraterrestrial Bashar;&nbsp;Nick Pope, former assistant to the UK Ministry of Defense investigator into UAPs /UFOs;&nbsp;Grant Cameron, expert on American presidents and UFOs;&nbsp;Drs. J.J. and Desiree Hurtak, globalists and founders of the worldwide organization, The Academy for Future Science; Caroline Cory, director of&nbsp;<i>Superhuman</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>ET: Contact</i>;&nbsp;Mary Rodwell, author of the&nbsp;<i>New Human</i>&nbsp;about star-seed children;&nbsp;Henrietta Weekes, actress and writer, expressing the poetic aspects of making contact.&nbsp;Alan Steinfeld, contributes and curates the collection with 30 years of experience with the subject. The foreword by&nbsp;George Noory&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>Coast to Coast AM</i>&nbsp;kicks off the volume with his veteran overview of the need to wake up to the&nbsp;“<i>new realities of extraterrestrial existence</i>”.</p> <p>At this critical juncture in the government’s official acknowledgement of the reality of UFOs/UAPs, scientists, politicians, and mainstream news outlets have no idea what to make of these startling revelations or the outpouring of sightings and “contact” experiences currently being reported on a global scale. The book stands as the most comprehensive clarification to date on the intent and intelligence behind the phenomena. The variety of viewpoints expressed in the volume provide a solid foundation for the <i>“preparation</i>”<i>&nbsp;</i>of the greatest challenge to ever face humankind.</p> <p><i>Making Contact&nbsp;</i>stands as the essential handbook for embracing the most exalted moment in history: Meeting the cosmic others.</p> <p><b>This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF that contains comparative diagrams and contributor biographies from the printed book</b></p>";
