window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A master class in strategic thinking, distilled from the legendary program the author has co-taught at Yale for decades.</b></p> <p>For over 20 years, a select group of Yale undergraduates has been admitted into the year-long \"Grand Strategy\" seminar team-taught by John Lewis Gaddis and Paul Kennedy. Its purpose: to provide a grounding in strategic decision-making in the face of crisis to prepare future American leaders for important work. Now, John Lewis Gaddis has transposed the experience of that course into a wonderfully succinct, lucid and inspirational book, a view from the commanding heights of statesmanship across the landscape of world history from the ancient Greeks to Lincoln, and beyond. A thrilling experience for history lovers and a necessary one for anyone serious about the art of leadership, <i>On Grand Strategy</i> is the very definition of a master class.</p>";
