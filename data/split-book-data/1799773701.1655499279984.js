window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Forget the speculation of pundits and media personalities. For anyone asking \"Now what?\" the answer is out there. You just have to know where to look.</b></p> <p>In his 2005 book, <i>The Long Emergency</i>, James Howard Kunstler described the global predicaments that would pitch the USA into political and economic turmoil in the 21st century - the end of affordable oil, climate irregularities, and flagging economic growth, to name a few. Now, he returns with a book that takes an up-close-and-personal approach to how real people are living <i>now</i> - surviving The Long Emergency as it happens.</p> <p>Through his popular blog, Clusterf**ck Nation, Kunstler has had the opportunity to connect with people from across the country. They’ve shared their stories with him - sometimes over years of correspondence - and in <i>Living in the Long Emergency: Global Crisis, the Failure of the Futurists, and the Early Adapters Who Are Showing Us the Way Forward</i>, he shares them with us, offering an eye-opening and unprecedented look at what’s really going on \"out there\" in the US - and beyond.</p> <p>Coming from all walks of life, the individuals you’ll meet in these pages have one thing in common: their stories acutely illustrate the changing realities real people are facing - and coping with - every day. In profiles of their fascinating lives, Kunstler paints vivid, human portraits that offer a “slice of life” from people whose struggles and triumphs all too often go ignored.</p> <p>With personal accounts from a Vermont baker, homesteaders, a building contractor in the Baltimore ghetto, a white nationalist, and many more, <i>Living in the Long Emergency</i> is a unique and timely exploration of how the lives of everyday Americans are being transformed, for better and for worse, and what these stories tell us both about the future and about human perseverance.</p>";
