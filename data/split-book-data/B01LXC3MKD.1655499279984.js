window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A scientist's exploration into the mysteries of the human mind.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Neuroscience studies the brain, but what does science have to say about the mind? A full examination of what we mean by the term \"mind\" has traditionally been the province of philosophers, but what might neuroscience teach us about it? How does the mind differ from consciousness? And how do we know who we really are?&nbsp;</p> <p>In this book, noted neuroscientist and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., brings his characteristic sensitivity and interdisciplinary background to this most perplexing of topics. He explores the nature of the who, how, what, why, and when of your mind - of your self - from the perspective of neuroscience. <i>Mind</i> is the essence of our true nature, our deepest sense of being alive, here, right now, in this moment. How science explains it is truly one of the most exciting journeys into knowledge we can take.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title,&nbsp;the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
