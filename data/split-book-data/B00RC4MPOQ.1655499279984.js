window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Brain That Changes Itself</i> presents astounding advances in the treatment of brain injury and illness. Now with a new afterword.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Winner of the 2015 Gold Nautilus Award in Science &amp; Cosmology&nbsp;</b></p> <p>In <i>The Brain That Changes Itself</i>, Norman Doidge described the most important breakthrough in our understanding of the brain in 400 years: the discovery that the brain can change its own structure and function in response to mental experience - what we call neuroplasticity.&nbsp;</p> <p>His revolutionary new book shows, for the first time, how the amazing process of neuroplastic healing really works. It describes natural, noninvasive avenues into the brain provided by the forms of energy around us - light, sound, vibration, movement - which pass through our senses and our bodies to awaken the brain's own healing capacities without producing unpleasant side effects. Doidge explores cases where patients alleviated years of chronic pain or recovered from debilitating strokes that had plateaued; children on the autistic spectrum or with learning disorders normalizing; symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral palsy radically improved; and other near-miracle recoveries. And we learn how to vastly reduce the risk of dementia with simple approaches anyone can use.&nbsp;</p> <p>For centuries it was believed that the brain's complexity prevented recovery from damage or illness. <i>The Brain's Way of Healing</i> shows that this very sophistication is the source of a unique kind of healing. As he did so lucidly in <i>The Brain That Changes Itself</i>, Doidge uses stories to present exciting, cutting-edge science with practical real-world applications and principles that everyone can apply to improve their brains' performance and health.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
