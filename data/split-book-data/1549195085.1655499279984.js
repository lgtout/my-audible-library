window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The epic story and ultimate big history of how human society evolved from intimate chimp communities into the sprawling civilizations of a world-dominating species</b></p> <p>If a chimpanzee ventures into the territory of a different group, it will almost certainly be killed. But a New Yorker can fly to Los Angeles - or Borneo - with very little fear. Psychologists have done little to explain this: for years, they have held that our biology puts a hard upper limit - about 150 people - on the size of our social groups. But human societies are in fact vastly larger. How do we manage - by and large - to get along with each other?</p> <p>In this paradigm-shattering book, biologist Mark W. Moffett draws on findings in psychology, sociology, and anthropology to explain the social adaptations that bind societies. He explores how the tension between identity and anonymity defines how societies develop, function, and fail. Surpassing <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> and <i>Sapiens</i>, <i>The Human Swarm </i>reveals how mankind created sprawling civilizations of unrivaled complexity - and what it will take to sustain them.</p>";
