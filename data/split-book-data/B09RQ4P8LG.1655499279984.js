window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Forget the language instinct - this is the story of how we make up language as we&nbsp;go.</b></p> <p>Language is perhaps humanity’s most astonishing capacity - and one that remains poorly understood. In&nbsp;<i>The Language Game</i>,&nbsp;cognitive&nbsp;scientists&nbsp;Morten&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Christiansen&nbsp;and Nick Chater&nbsp;show&nbsp;us where generations of scientists&nbsp;seeking&nbsp;the rules of&nbsp;language&nbsp;got it wrong. Language isn’t about hardwired&nbsp;grammars&nbsp;but about near-total freedom, something like a game of charades, with the only requirement being a desire to&nbsp;understand and&nbsp;be understood.&nbsp;From this new vantage&nbsp;point,&nbsp;Christiansen and Chater find compelling&nbsp;solutions to&nbsp;major&nbsp;mysteries&nbsp;like&nbsp;the origins of languages&nbsp;and&nbsp;how language learning is possible,&nbsp;and to long-running debates&nbsp;such as whether&nbsp;having two words for “blue” changes what we see. In the end,&nbsp;they show&nbsp;that&nbsp;the only real&nbsp;constraint&nbsp;on communication&nbsp;is&nbsp;our&nbsp;imagination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
