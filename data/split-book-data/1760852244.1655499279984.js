window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A powerful, timely exploration of the art of living and dying on our own terms&nbsp;by one of Australiaâ€™s most respected voices</b></p> <p>Of all the experiences we share, two universal events bookend our lives: We were all born, and we will all die. We don't have a choice in how we enter the world, but we can have a say in how we leave it.</p> <p>In order to die well, we must be prepared to contemplate our mortality and to broach it with our loved ones, who are often called upon to make important decisions on our behalf. These are some of the most important conversations we can have with each other - to find peace, kindness and gratitude for what has gone before and acceptance of what is to come.</p> <p>Dr Ranjana Srivastava draws on two decades of experience to share her observations and advice on leading a meaningful life and finding dignity and composure at the end. With an emphasis on advocacy, leaving a legacy, and staying true to our deepest convictions, Srivastava tells stories of strength, hope, and resilience in the face of grief and offers an optimistic meditation on approaching the end of life.</p> <p>Intelligent, warm, and deeply affecting, <i>A Better Death</i> is a passionate exploration of the art of living and dying well.</p> <p><b>Dr Ranjana Srivastava OAM is a practicing oncologist, award-winning writer, broadcaster, and Fulbright scholar.
