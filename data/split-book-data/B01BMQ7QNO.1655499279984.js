window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of <i>The Fever</i>, a wide-ranging inquiry into the origins of pandemics</b> </p> <p>Interweaving history, original reportage, and personal narrative, <i>Pandemic</i> explores the origin of epidemics, drawing parallels between the story of cholera - one of history's most disruptive and deadly pathogens - and the new pathogens that stalk humankind today, from Ebola and avian influenza to drug-resistant superbugs. </p> <p>More than 300 infectious diseases have emerged or reemerged in new territory during the past 50 years, and 90 percent of epidemiologists expect that one of them will cause a disruptive, deadly pandemic sometime in the next two generations. </p> <p>To reveal how that might happen, Sonia Shah tracks each stage of cholera's dramatic journey from harmless microbe to world-changing pandemic, from its 1817 emergence in the South Asian hinterlands to its rapid dispersal across the 19th-century world and its latest beachhead in Haiti. She reports on the pathogens following in cholera's footsteps, from the MRSA bacterium that besieges her own family to the never-before-seen killers emerging from China's wet markets, the surgical wards of New Delhi, the slums of Port-au-Prince, and the suburban backyards of the East Coast. </p> <p>By delving into the convoluted science, strange politics, and checkered history of one of the world's deadliest diseases, <i>Pandemic</i> reveals what the next epidemic might look like - and what we can do to prevent it. </p>";
