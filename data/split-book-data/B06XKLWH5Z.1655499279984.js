window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A revolutionary new approach to addiction recovery from an addiction expert. </p> <p><i>Rewired</i> is a new breakthrough approach to fighting addiction and self-damaging behavior by acknowledging our personal power to bring ourselves back from the brink. Centered on the concept of self-actualization, <i>Rewired</i> will guide you toward not only physical sobriety but a mental, emotional, and spiritual sobriety by learning to identify key principles within yourself, including authenticity, honesty, gratitude, and understanding a need for solitude. </p> <p><i>Rewired</i> addresses the whole self; just as addiction affects every part of one's life, so, too, must its treatment. By helping us to build a healthy space to support our own recovery, we can rewrite the negative behaviors that result in addiction. Usable in conjunction with or in place of 12-step programs, <i>Rewired</i> allows for a more holistic approach, helping to create a personalized treatment plan that is right for you. </p> <p>Each section in <i>Rewired</i> includes: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Personal anecdotes from the author's own struggles with alcoholism and addiction </li> <li>Inspiring true success stories of patients overcoming their addictions </li> <li>Questions to engage you into finding what is missing from your recovery </li> <li>Positive affirmations and intentions to guide and motivate </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>With all the variables, both physical and emotional, that play into overcoming addiction, <i>Rewired</i> enables us to stay strong and positive as we progress on the path to recovery. <i>Rewired</i> teaches patience and compassion, the two cornerstones of a new humanist approach to curing addiction. Remember, addicts are not broken people who need to be fixed - they just have a few crossed wires. </p>";
