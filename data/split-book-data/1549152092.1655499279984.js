window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>How to&nbsp;create&nbsp;the change you want to see in the world using the paradigm-busting ideas in this&nbsp;\"utterly fascinating\" (Adam Grant)&nbsp;big-idea&nbsp;book.â€‹ </b></p> <p>Most of what we know about how ideas spread comes from best-selling authors who give us a compelling picture of a world, in which \"influencers\" are king, \"sticky\" ideas \"go viral\", and good behavior is \"nudged\" forward. The problem is that the world they describe is a world where information spreads, but beliefs and behaviors stay the same.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to lasting change in what we think or the way we live, the dynamics are different: beliefs and behaviors are not transmitted from person to person in the simple way that a virus is. The real story of social change is more complex. When we are exposed to a new idea, our social networks guide our responses in striking and surprising ways.&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing on deep-yet-accessible research and fascinating examples from the spread of coronavirus to the success of the Black Lives Matter movement, the failure of Google+, and the rise of political polarization, <i>Change</i> presents groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting new science for understanding what drives change, and how we can change the world around us.</p>";
