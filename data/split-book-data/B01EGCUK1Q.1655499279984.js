window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Renowned for the beauty and simplicity of his teachings, Ajahn Chah was Thailand's best-known meditation teacher. His charisma and wisdom influenced many American and European seekers, and helped shape the American Vipassana community. </p> <p>This collection brings together for the first time Ajahn Chah's most powerful teachings, including those on meditation, liberation from suffering, calming the mind, enlightenment and the \"living dhamma\". Most of these talks have previously only been available in limited, private editions and the publication of <i>Food for the Heart</i>, therefore, represents a momentous occasion: the hugely increased accessibility of his words and wisdom. </p> <p>Western teachers such as Ram Dass and Jack Kornfield have extolled Chah's teachings for years, and now listeners can experience them directly in this book. </p>";
