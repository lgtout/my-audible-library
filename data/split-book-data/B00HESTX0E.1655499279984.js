window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can you make yourself, your kids, and your parents smarter? </p> <p>Expanding upon one of the most-read <i>New York Times Magazine</i> features of 2012, <i>Smarter</i> penetrates the hot new field of intelligence research to reveal what researchers call a revolution in human intellectual abilities. Shattering decades of dogma, scientists began publishing studies in 2008 showing that \"fluid intelligence\" - the ability to learn, solve novel problems, and get to the heart of things - can be increased through training. But is it all just hype? </p> <p>With vivid stories of lives transformed, science journalist Dan Hurley delivers practical findings for people of every age and ability. Along the way, he narrates with acid-tongued wit his experiences as a human guinea pig, road-testing commercial brain-training programs, learning to play the Renaissance lute, getting physically fit, even undergoing transcranial direct-current stimulation. </p> <p><i>Smarter</i> speaks to the audience that made best-sellers out of <i>Train Your Mind</i>, <i>Change Your Brain</i>, and <i>Moonwalking with Einstein</i>.</p>";
