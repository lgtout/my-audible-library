window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A radically new understanding of and practical approach to climate change by noted environmentalist Paul Hawken, creator of the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b><b><i>Drawdown</i></b></p> <p><i>Regeneration</i> offers a visionary new approach to climate change, one that weaves justice, climate, biodiversity, equity, and human dignity into a seamless tapestry of action, policy, and transformation that can end the climate crisis in one generation. It is the first book to describe and define the burgeoning regeneration movement spreading rapidly throughout the world.</p> <p><i>Regeneration</i> describes how an inclusive movement can engage the majority of humanity to save the world from the threat of global warming, with climate solutions that directly serve our children, the poor, and the excluded. This means we must address current human needs, not future existential threats, real as they are, with initiatives that include but go well beyond solar, electric vehicles, and tree planting to include such solutions as the fifteen-minute city, bioregions, azolla fern, food localization, fire ecology, decommodification, forests as farms, and the number one solution for the world: electrifying everything.</p> <p>Paul Hawken and the nonprofit Regeneration Organization are launching a series of initiatives to accompany the book, including a streaming video series, curriculum, podcasts, teaching videos, and climate action software. <i>Regeneration</i> is the inspiring and necessary guide to inform the rapidly spreading climate movement.</p> <p><b>* This audiobook includes&nbsp;a downloadable PDF with Avoided emissions in carbon dioxide equivalence, Organic carbon stocks, and the Acknowledgements.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
