window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>You Say You Want a Revolution?</i>, Daniel Chirot examines a wide range of right- and left-wing revolutions around the world - from the late 18th century to today - to provide important new answers to these critical questions.</p> <p>From the French Revolution of the 18th century to the Mexican, Russian, German, Chinese, anticolonial, and Iranian revolutions of the 20th, Chirot finds that moderate solutions to serious social, economic, and political problems were overwhelmed by radical ideologies that promised simpler, drastic remedies.&nbsp;</p> <p>But not all revolutions had this outcome. The American Revolution didn't, although its failure to resolve the problem of slavery eventually led to the Civil War, and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe was relatively peaceful, except in Yugoslavia.&nbsp;</p> <p>From Japan, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cambodia to Algeria, Angola, Haiti, and Romania, <i>You Say You Want a Revolution? </i>explains why violent radicalism, corruption, and the betrayal of ideals won in so many crucial cases, why it didn't in some others - and what the long-term prospects for major social change are if liberals can't deliver needed reforms.</p>";
