window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Joining the ranks of <i>Unbroken</i>, <i>Band of Brothers</i>, and <i>The Boys in the Boat</i>, the little-known saga of young German Jews, dubbed the Ritchie Boys, who fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s, came of age in America, and returned to Europe at enormous personal risk as members of the US Army to play a key role in the Allied victory. </p> <p>In 1942 the US Army unleashed one of its greatest secret weapons in the battle to defeat Adolf Hitler: training nearly 2,000 German-born Jews in special interrogation techniques and making use of their mastery of the German language, history, and customs. Known as the Ritchie Boys, they were sent in small, elite teams to join every major combat unit in Europe, where they interrogated German POWs and gathered crucial intelligence that saved American lives and helped win the war. </p> <p>Though they knew what the Nazis would do to them if they were captured, the Ritchie Boys eagerly joined the fight to defeat Hitler. As they did, many of them did not know the fates of their own families left behind in occupied Europe. Taking part in every major campaign in Europe, they collected key tactical intelligence on enemy strength, troop and armored movements, and defensive positions. A postwar army report found that more than 60 percent of the credible intelligence gathered in Europe came from the Ritchie Boys. </p> <p>Bruce Henderson draws on personal interviews with many surviving veterans and extensive archival research to bring this never-before-told chapter of the Second World War to light. <i>Sons and Soldiers</i> traces their stories from childhood and their escapes from Nazi Germany, through their feats and sacrifices during the war, to their desperate attempts to find their missing loved ones in war-torn Europe. <i>Sons and Soldiers</i> is an epic story of heroism, courage, and patriotism that will not soon be forgotten. </p>";
