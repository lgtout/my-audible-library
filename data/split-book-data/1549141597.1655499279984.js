window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Esquire, Most Anticipated Books of 2019</b><br> <b><i>Library Journal</i></b><b>, Editors' Fall Picks for 2019</b></p> <p><b>This is a witch hunt. We're witches, and we're hunting you.</b></p> <p>From the moment powerful men started falling to the #MeToo movement, the lamentations began: This is feminism gone too far, this is injustice, this is a witch hunt. In <i>The Witches Are Coming</i>, firebrand author of the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling memoir and now critically acclaimed Hulu TV series <i>Shrill </i>Lindy West turns that refrain on its head. You think this is a witch hunt? Fine. You've got one.</p> <p>In a laugh-out-loud, incisive cultural critique, West extolls the world-changing magic of truth, urging listeners to reckon with dark lies in the heart of the American mythos, and unpacking the complicated, and sometimes tragic, politics of not being a white man in the 21st century. She tracks the misogyny and propaganda hidden (or not so hidden) in the media she and her peers devoured growing up, a buffet of distortions, delusions, prejudice, and outright bullsh*t that has allowed white male mediocrity to maintain a death grip on American culture and politics-and that delivered us to this precarious, disorienting moment in history.</p> <p>West writes, \"We were just a hair's breadth from electing America's first female president to succeed America's first black president. We weren't done, but we were doing it. And then, true to form-like the Balrog's whip catching Gandalf by his little gray bootie, like the husband in a Lifetime movie hissing, 'If I can't have you, no one can' - white American voters shoved an incompetent, racist con man into the White House.\"</p> <p>We cannot understand how we got here - how the land of the free became Trump's America - without examining the chasm between who we are and who we think we are, without fact-checking the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and each other. The truth can transform us; there is witchcraft in it. Lindy West turns on the light.</p>";
