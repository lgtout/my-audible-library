window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brain science is at the dawn of a new era - and the technologies emerging as a result could forever alter what it means to be human. </b></p> <p><b>Welcome to what tech pioneer and inventor Tan Le calls “the NeuroGeneration.” It will blow your mind. </b></p> <p>The human brain is perhaps the most powerful and mysterious arrangement of matter in the known universe. New discoveries that unravel this mystery and let us tap into this power offer almost limitless potential - the ability to reshape ourselves and our thought processes, to improve our health and extend our lives, and to enhance and augment the ways we interact with the world around us. It may sound like the stuff of science fiction, but it is quickly becoming reality.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The NeuroGeneration</i>, award-winning inventor Tan Le explores exciting advancements in brain science and neurotechnology that are revolutionizing the way we think, work, and heal. Join Le as she criss-crosses the globe, introducing the brilliant neurotech innovators and neuroscientists at the frontiers of brain enhancement. Along the way, she shares incredible stories from individuals whose lives are already being transformed by their inventions - an endurance racer paralyzed in a fall, who now walks thanks to neural stimulation and an exoskeleton; a man who drives a race car with his mind; even a color-blind “cyborg” whose brain implant allows him to “hear” colors.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The NeuroGeneration</i> reveals the dizzying array of emerging technologies - including cranial stimulation that makes you learn faster, an artificial hippocampus that restores lost memories, and neural implants that aim to help us keep up with or even outpace artificial intelligence - that promise to alter the brain in unprecedented ways, unlocking human potential we never dreamed possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>Le also explores how these futuristic innovations will impact our world, disrupt the way we do business, upend healthcare as we know it, and remake our lives in wondrous and unexpected ways. As fascinating as it is timely, <i>The NeuroGeneration</i> offers a thrilling glimpse of the future of our species, and how changing our brains can change human life as we know it.</p>";
