window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Americans have long been taught that events such as the notorious My Lai massacre were \"isolated incidents\" in the Vietnam War, carried out by a few \"bad apples.\" However, as award-winning journalist and historian Nick Turse demonstrates in this pioneering investigation, violence against Vietnamese civilians was not at all exceptional. Rather, it was pervasive and systematic, the predictable consequence of official orders to \"kill anything that moves.\" </p> <p>Drawing on a decade of research into secret Pentagon files and extensive interviews with American veterans and Vietnamese survivors, Turse reveals the policies and actions that resulted in millions of innocent civilians killed and wounded. He lays out in shocking detail the workings of a military machine that made crimes all but inevitable. </p> <p><i>Kill Anything That Moves</i> finally brings us face-to-face with the truth of a war that haunts America to this day. </p>";
