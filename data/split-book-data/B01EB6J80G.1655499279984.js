window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Because We Say So</i> presents more than 30 concise, forceful commentaries on US politics and global power. Written between 2011 and 2015, Noam Chomsky's arguments forge a persuasive counternarrative to official accounts of US politics and policies during global crisis. Find here classic Chomsky on the increasing urgency of climate change, the ongoing impact of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing, nuclear politics, cyberwar, terrorism, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Israel and the Middle East, security, and state power as well as deeper reflections on the Obama doctrine, political philosophy, the Magna Carta, and the importance of a commons to democracy. </p> <p><i>Because We Say So</i> is the third in a series of books by Chomsky published by City Lights Publishers that includes <i>Making the Future</i> (2012) and <i>Interventions</i> (2007), a book banned by US military censors. Taken together, the three books present a complete collection of the articles Chomsky writes regularly for the New York Times Syndicate and are largely ignored by newspapers in the United States. <i>Because We Say So</i> offers fierce, accessible, timely, gloves-off political writing by America's foremost public intellectual and political dissident. </p>";
