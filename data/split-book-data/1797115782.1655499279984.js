There are few tomes that coherently map such broad economic histories as well as Mr. Dalio’s. Perhaps more unusually, Mr. Dalio has managed to identify metrics from that history that can be applied to understand today.” (Andrew Ross Sorkin, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>From legendary investor Ray Dalio, author of the number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b><b><i>Principles</i></b><b>, who has spent half a century studying global economies and markets, </b><b><i>Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order</i></b><b> examines history’s most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we’ve experienced in our lifetimes - and to offer practical advice on how to navigate them well. </b></p> <p>A few years ago, Ray Dalio noticed a confluence of political and economic conditions he hadn’t encountered before. They included huge debts and zero or near-zero interest rates that led to the massive printing of money in the world’s three major reserve currencies; big political and social conflicts within countries, especially the US, due to the largest wealth, political, and values disparities in more than 100 years; and the rising of a world power (China) to challenge the existing world power (US) and the existing world order. The last time that this confluence occurred was between 1930 and 1945. This realization sent Dalio on a search for the repeating patterns and cause/effect relationships underlying all major changes in wealth and power over the last 500 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this remarkable and timely addition to his Principles series, Dalio brings listeners along for his study of the major empires - including the Dutch, the British, and the American - putting into perspective the “Big Cycle” that has driven the successes and failures of all the world’s major countries throughout history. He reveals the timeless and universal forces behind these shifts and uses them to look into the future, offering practical principles for positioning oneself for what’s ahead.</p>";
