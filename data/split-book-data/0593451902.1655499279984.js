They had been trading home decorating inspiration boards in their last text conversation so&nbsp;Brené&nbsp;started scrolling to find her latest Pinterest pictures when the phone rang.</p> <p>But&nbsp;it was immediately clear to&nbsp;Brené&nbsp;that the conversation wasn’t going to be about wallpaper. Tarana’s <i>hello</i> was serious, and she hesitated for a bit before saying, “Brené, you know your work affected me so deeply, but as a Black woman, I’ve&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;had to feel like I have to contort myself to fit into some of your words. The core of it rings so true for me, but the application has been harder.”</p> <p>Brené&nbsp;replied, “I’m so glad we’re talking about this. It makes sense to me. Especially in terms of vulnerability. How do you take the armor off in a country where you’re not physically or emotionally safe?”</p> <p>Long pause.</p> <p>“That’s why I’m calling,” said Tarana. “What do you think about working together on a book about the black experience with vulnerability and shame resilience?”</p> <p>There was no hesitation.</p> <p>Burke and Brown are the perfect pair to usher in this stark, potent collection of essays on black shame and healing. Along with the anthology contributors, they create a space to recognize and process the trauma of white supremacy, a space to be vulnerable and affirm the fullness of black love and black life.</p>";
