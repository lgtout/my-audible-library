window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An eye-opening, myth-busting exploration of how the human body can best recover and adapt to sports and fitness training </b></p> <p>In recent years \"recovery\" has become a sports and fitness buzzword. Anyone who works out or competes at any level is bombarded with the latest recovery products and services: from drinks and shakes to compression sleeves, foam rollers, electrical muscle stimulators, and sleep trackers.</p> <p>In<i> Good to Go</i>, acclaimed FiveThirtyEight science writer Christie Aschwanden takes listeners on an entertaining and enlightening tour through this strange world. She investigates whether drinking Gatorade or beer after training helps or hinders performance, she examines the latest trends among athletes - from NFL star Tom Brady's infrared pajamas to gymnast Simone Biles' pneumatic compression boots to swimmer Michael Phelps' \"cupping\" ritual - and she tests some of the most controversial methods herself, including cryochambers, floatation tanks, and infrared saunas.</p> <p>At a time when the latest recovery products and services promise so much, <i>Good to Go</i> seeks answers to the fundamental question: Do any of them actually help the body recover and achieve peak performance?</p>";
