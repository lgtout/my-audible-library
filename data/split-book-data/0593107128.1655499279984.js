window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Part memoir, part guidebook, and part social history, </b><b><i>For Small Creatures Such as We</i></b><b> is the first book from the daughter of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan - a luminous exploration of Earth's marvels that require no faith in order to be believed. </b></p> <p><b>\"What is the meaning of life? Sagan finds its meaning everywhere - with her family, around the world, and especially among the stars of the cosmos. Read her work; you'll have a deeper appreciation for your every step, every bite, and every breath.\" (Bill Nye) </b></p> <p>Sasha Sagan was raised by secular parents, the astronomer Carl Sagan and the writer and producer Ann Druyan. They taught her that the natural world and vast cosmos are full of profound beauty, that science reveals truths more wondrous than any myth or fable.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Sagan herself became a mother, she began her own hunt for the natural phenomena behind our most treasured occasions - from births to deaths, holidays to weddings, anniversaries, and more - growing these roots into a new set of rituals for her young daughter that honor the joy and significance of each experience without relying on religious framework.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Sagan shares these rituals, <i>For Small Creatures Such as We</i> becomes a moving tribute to a father, a newborn daughter, a marriage, and the natural world - a celebration of life itself, and the power of our families and beliefs to bring us together.</p>";
