window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A groundbreaking book about making once-in-a-lifetime decisions, from the best-selling author of </b><b><i>How We Got to Now </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Where Good Ideas Come From</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Plenty of books offer useful advice on how to get better at making quick-thinking, intuitive choices. But what about more consequential decisions, the ones that affect our lives for years or centuries to come? Our most powerful stories revolve around these kinds of decisions: where to live, whom to marry, what to believe, whether to start a company, how to end a war.</p> <p>Full of the beautifully crafted storytelling and novel insights that Steven Johnson's fans know to expect, <i>Farsighted</i> draws lessons from cognitive science, social psychology, military strategy, environmental planning, and great works of literature. Everyone thinks we are living in an age of short attention spans, but we've actually learned a lot about making long-term decisions over the past few decades. Johnson makes a compelling case for a smarter and more deliberative decision-making approach. He argues that we choose better when we break out of the myopia of single-scale thinking and develop methods for considering all the factors involved.</p> <p>There's no one-size-fits-all model for the important decisions that can alter the course of a life, an organization, or a civilization. But <i>Farsighted</i> explains how we can approach these choices more effectively and how we can appreciate the subtle intelligence of choices that shaped our broader social history.</p>";
