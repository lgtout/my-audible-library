window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Best-selling author and world-renowned historian Niall Ferguson has won widespread acclaim for thought-provoking works such as <i>Civilization</i> and <i>High Financier. The Great Degeneration</i> tackles nothing less than the decline of Western civilization. Ferguson posits that slowing growth, outrageous debt, and antisocial behavior are contributing to the erosion of the West’s once rock-solid foundations. Ferguson excavates the causes and shows how heroic leadership and radical reform are needed to right the course.</p>";
