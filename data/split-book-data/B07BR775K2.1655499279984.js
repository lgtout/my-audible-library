window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As we approach a great turning point in history when technology is poised to redefine what it means to be human, <i>The Fourth Age </i>offers fascinating insight into AI, robotics, and their extraordinary implications for our species.</p> <p>In <i>The Fourth Age</i>, Byron Reese makes the case that technology has reshaped humanity just three times in history:</p> <p>100,000 years ago we harnessed fire, which led to language.</p> <p>10,000 years ago we developed agriculture, which led to cities and warfare.</p> <p>5,000 years ago we invented the wheel and writing, which led to the nation state.</p> <p>We are now on the doorstep of a fourth change brought about by two technologies: AI and robotics.<i> The Fourth Age</i> provides extraordinary background information on how we got to this point and <i>how</i> - rather than <i>what</i> - we should think about the topics we’ll soon all be facing: machine consciousness, automation, employment, creative computers, radical life extension, artificial life, AI ethics, the future of warfare, superintelligence, and the implications of extreme prosperity.</p> <p>By asking questions like “are you a machine?” and “could a computer <i>feel </i>anything?”, Reese leads you through a discussion along the cutting edge in robotics and AI and provides a framework by which we can all understand, discuss, and act on the issues of the Fourth Age and how they’ll transform humanity.</p>";
