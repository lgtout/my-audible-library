window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is revealed when you authentically connect with the people around you?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Ask Powerful Questions</i>, Will Wise explains how the questions we traditionally ask are virtually meaningless when it comes to establishing connection. Introducing a set of practical tools for accessing and understanding others by changing the way we ask questions, Will shows how to transform \"How are you? I'm fine, thanks\" into a conversation that changes not only how you lead, but who you are as a person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>It took years of research, university teaching, and hundreds of client projects for Will to formulate his concept behind the art of asking powerful questions. In his audiobook, Will breaks it down into six simple steps and a framework.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \"Asking Powerful Questions Pyramid\" shows you how to build:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Intention</li> <li>Rapport</li> <li>Openness</li> <li>Listening</li> <li>Empathy</li> </ul> <p>Business professionals, personal coaches, teachers, and anyone in a position of leadership will relate to the personal successes and failures Will shares as he unpacks the art of asking questions that elicit unconventional answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Powerful questions can be used everywhere: from the board room to the city park, the dinner table to the grocery store. If you want to connect with employees at a team-building retreat, hone your leadership skills as a new boss, or improve the company culture where you work...this audiobook is for you. If you want to navigate difficult conversations with your spouse or a friend or practice presence-based listening with your kids...this audiobook is for you. If you want to become a better educator and facilitate an ice-breaker conversation with colleagues...this audiobook is for you.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Ask Powerful Questions</i> invites the listener on a journey that explores the clarity of intent, connecting through rapport, creating openness, reflective listening, and empathy.&nbsp;</p> <p>How can we explore the space between ourselves and others and exchange meaningful perspectives? Just ask - powerfully.</p>";
