window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this revelatory memoir, Doctor Cynthia Li shares the truth about her disabling autoimmune illness, the limitations of Western medicine, and her hard-won lessons on healing - mind, body, and spirit.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Li had it all: a successful career in medicine, a loving marriage, children on the horizon. But it all came crashing&nbsp;down when, after&nbsp;developing an autoimmune thyroid condition, mysterious symptoms began consuming her body. Test after test came&nbsp;back \"within normal limits\", baffling her doctors - and baffling herself. Housebound with two young&nbsp;children, Li began a solo odyssey from her living room&nbsp;couch to find a way to heal.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Brave New Medicine&nbsp;</i>details the physical and&nbsp;existential&nbsp;crisis that forces a young doctor to question her own medical training. She dives into&nbsp;the root causes of her illness, learning to unlock her body's innate intelligence and wholeness. Li relates her story with the insight of a scientist, and the humility and candor of a patient,&nbsp;exploring the&nbsp;emotional and spiritual shifts&nbsp;beyond the physical body.&nbsp;</p> <p>Millions of&nbsp;people worldwide are affected by autoimmune disease. While complex conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are gaining attention, patients&nbsp;struggling&nbsp;with these mysterious ailments remain largely dismissed by their doctors, families, and&nbsp;friends. This is the harsh reality that doctor-turned-\"difficult patient\" Li faced firsthand.</p> <p>Drawing on cutting-edge science, ancient healing arts, and the power of intuition, this memoir offers support, validation, and a new perspective for doctors and patients alike. Through her story, you can find the wisdom and heart to start your own&nbsp;healing journey, too.</p>";
