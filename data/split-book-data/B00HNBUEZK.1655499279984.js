window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What are the arguments for and against religion and religious belief - all of them - right across the range of reasons and motives that people have for being religious, and do they stand up to scrutiny? Can there be a clear, full statement of these arguments that once and for all will show what is at stake in this debate? Equally important: what is the alternative to religion as a view of the world and a foundation for morality? Is there a worldview and a code of life for thoughtful people - those who wish to live with intellectual integrity, based on reason, evidence, and a desire to do and be good - that does not interfere with people's right to their own beliefs and freedom of expression? In <i>The Case Against Religion</i>, Anthony Grayling offers a definitive examination of these questions, and an in-depth exploration of the humanist outlook that recommends itself as the ethics of the genuinely reflective person. </p>";
