window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Sustainable” has long been the rallying cry of agricultural progressives; given that much of our nation’s farm and ranch land is already degraded, however, sustainable agriculture often means maintaining a less-than-ideal status quo. Industrial agriculture has also co-opted the term for marketing purposes without implementing better practices. Stephanie Anderson&nbsp;argues that&nbsp;in order to provide nutrient-rich food and fight climate change, we need to move beyond sustainable to regenerative agriculture, a practice that is highly tailored to local environments and renews resources.</p> <p>In <i>One Size Fits None</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>Anderson follows&nbsp;diverse farmers across the United States:&nbsp;A South Dakota&nbsp;bison&nbsp;rancher who provides an alternative to the industrial feedlot; an organic vegetable farmer in Florida who&nbsp;harvests&nbsp;microgreens;&nbsp;a&nbsp;New Mexico super-small farmer who revitalizes communities; and a North Dakota midsize farmer who combines livestock and grain farming to convert expensive farmland back to native prairie. The use of these nontraditional agricultural techniques show how varied operations can give back to the earth rather than degrade it.&nbsp;</p> <p>The book is published by University of Nebraska Press. The audiobook is published by University Press Audiobooks.</p> <p>\"An invaluable resource, a step in the right direction of imagining alternative way of doing and organizing life around the soil and farming.\" <i>(Grist: A Journal of the Literary Arts</i>)</p> <p>“A brave and clear-eyed book by a farmer’s daughter about the problems in our agriculture and the factors that keep farmers from making it better.” (Kristin Ohlson, author of <i>The Soil Will Save Us</i>)</p> <p>“Should be required listening for anyone who yearns for a clear-headed and informed account of our dysfunctional corporate food system.” (Andrew Furman, author of <i>Bitten: My Unexpected Love Affair with Florida</i>)</p>";
