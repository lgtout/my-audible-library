window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The coronavirus pandemic, the deepening economic crash, dangerously divisive political responses, and exploding social tensions have thrown an already declining American capitalist system into a tailspin. The consequences of these mounting and intertwined crises will shape our future. In this unique collection of over 50 essays, <i>The Sickness Is the System: When Capitalism Fails to Save Us from Pandemics or Itself</i>, Richard D. Wolff argues clearly that \"returning to normal\" no longer responds adequately to the accumulated problems of US capitalism. What is necessary, instead, is transition toward a new economic system that works for all of us.</p>";
