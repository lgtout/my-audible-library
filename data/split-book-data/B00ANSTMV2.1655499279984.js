Though more than 2,700 years old, their stories of brave heroics, capricious gods, and towering human emotions are vividly timeless. </p> <p>The Iliad can justly be called the world’s greatest war epic. The terrible and long-drawn-out siege of Troy remains one of the classic campaigns, the heroism and treachery of its combatants unmatched in song and story. Driven by fierce passions and loyalties, men and gods battle to a devastating conclusion. </p> <p>The <i>Odyssey</i> chronicles the many trials and adventures Odysseus must pass through on his long journey home from the Trojan wars to his beloved wife. Though the stormy god of the ocean has sworn vengeance against him, and witches and sirens try to lure him off course, Odysseus is clever and has the brilliant goddess Athena on his side. </p> <p>Homer (9th or 8th century B.C.) is the presumed author of the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey,</i> the two greatest epic poems of ancient Greece. Virtually nothing is known about his life. Tradition has it that he was blind. Most scholars believe he composed the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> by relying on oral traditions. Their value lies chiefly in the poetry itself, moving from sublime passages about the gods and heroic exploits to passages expressing deep human emotion.</p>";
