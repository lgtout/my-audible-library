At the heart of Te-Ping Chen’s remarkable debut lies a question all too relevant in 21st-century America: What is freedom?” (Jennifer Egan)</b></p> <p><b>“Immensely rewarding, from the first sentence to the last.... An exceptional collection.” (Charles Yu)</b></p> <p><b>A “stirring and brilliant” debut story collection, offering vivid portrayals of the men and women of modern China and its diaspora, “both love letter and sharp social criticism”, from a phenomenal new literary talent bringing great “insight from her years as a reporter with the </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal” </i></b><b>(</b><b><i>Elle</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p>Gripping and compassionate, <i>Land of Big Numbers</i> traces the journeys of the diverse and legion Chinese people, their history, their government, and how all of that has tumbled—messily, violently, but still beautifully—into the present.</p> <p>Cutting between clear-eyed realism and tongue-in-cheek magical realism, Chen’s stories coalesce into a portrait of a people striving for openings where mobility is limited. Twins take radically different paths: one becomes a professional gamer, the other a political activist. A woman moves to the city to work at a government call center and is followed by her violent ex-boyfriend. A man is swept into the high-risk, high-reward temptations of China’s volatile stock exchange. And a group of people sit, trapped for no reason, on a subway platform for months, waiting for official permission to leave.</p> <p>With acute social insight, Te-Ping Chen layers years of experience reporting on the ground in China with incantatory prose in this taut, surprising debut, proving herself both a remarkable cultural critic and an astonishingly accomplished new literary voice.</p>";
