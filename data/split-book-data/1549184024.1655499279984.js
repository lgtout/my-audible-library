window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An MSNBC political analyst and former Hillary Clinton staffer examines the past and present problems of the Left — and makes a compelling case for how to take back our government and secure a better future for America.</b></p> <p><i>In the entire history of the United States of America, we've never elected a woman as our president. And we've only had one president who was not a white man.</i></p> <p>After working on two presidential campaigns (for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton), MSNBC political analyst and SiriusXM host Zerlina Maxwell gained first-hand knowledge of everything liberals have been doing right over the past few elections-and everything they are still doing wrong. Ultimately, these errors worked in President Donald Trump's favor in 2016; he effectively ran a campaign on white identity politics, successfully tapping into white male angst and resistance. In 2020, after the Democratic Party's most historically diverse pool of presidential candidates finally dwindled down to Joe Biden, once again an older white man, Maxwell has posed the ultimate question: What now, liberals?</p> <p>Fueled by Maxwell's trademark wit and candor, <i>The End of White Politics </i>dismantles the past and present problems of the Left, challenging everyone from scrappy, young \"Bernie Bros\" to seasoned power players in the \"Billionaire Boys' Club\". No topic is taboo; whether tackling the white privilege that enabled Mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential run, the controversial #HashtagActivism of the Millennial generation, the massive individual donations that sway politicians toward maintaining the status quo of income inequality, or the lingering racism that debilitated some Democratic presidential contenders and cut their promising campaigns short, Maxwell pulls no punches in her fierce critique. However, underlying all of these individual issues, Maxwell argues that it's the \"liberal-minded\" party's struggle to engage women and communities of color — and its preoccupation with catering to the white, male working class — that threatens to be its most lethal shortfall.</p> <p>The times — and the demographics — are changing, and in order for progressive politics to prevail, we must acknowledge our shortcomings, take ownership of our flaws, and do everything in our power to level the playing field for <i>all </i>Americans. <i>The End of White Politics</i> shows exactly how and why progressives can lean <i>into </i>identity politics, empowering marginalized groups, and uniting under a common vision that will benefit us all.</p> <p><b><i>Time</i></b><b>, 100 Must-Read Books of 2020!</b></p> <p><b>\"Witty and piercing.\" (</b><b><i>Time)</i></b></p>";
