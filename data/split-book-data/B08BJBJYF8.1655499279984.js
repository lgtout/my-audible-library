The overlapping notes in this piece seem to come from that place, and like the dawn, they dissipate the cool mist of sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Our morning music tracks were created to help you start your day on the right foot but can be enjoyed any time of day. They're both contemplative and energizing and help to create a positive atmosphere whenever you're looking for an energy shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The musicians who contributed to this piece have all lent their musical talents to The Big Quiet events over the years and are longtime friends and collaborators. This piece was devised live, and each musician played a hand in the composition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The Big Quiet is a mass meditation movement that gathers thousands of people for large-scale moments of quiet around the world (including for Oprahâ€™s 2020 Vision Tour with WW). It was founded by Jesse Israel, whose own experience with debilitating panic attacks forced him to step back from a successful career as a music executive to seek help. When he came upon meditation, it inspired him to switch gears in a big way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This title is part of the Audible Sleep Collection, exclusive audio experiences created to help you fall asleep, stay asleep, and wake up in the right morning mindset.
