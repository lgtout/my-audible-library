window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>An Introduction to Carnism</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows </i>offers an absorbing look at what social psychologist Melanie Joy calls carnism, the belief system that conditions us to eat certain animals when we would never dream of eating others. Carnism causes extensive animal suffering and global injustice, and it drives us to act against our own interests and the interests of others without fully realizing what we are doing. Becoming aware of what carnism is and how it functions is vital to personal empowerment and social transformation, as it enables us to make our food choices more freely - because without awareness, there is no free choice.</p>";
