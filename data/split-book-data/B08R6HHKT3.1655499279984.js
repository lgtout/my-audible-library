window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audiobook includes a special 30-minute interview with the author.</p> <p><b>The first book to briefly and clearly present the science of climate change in a way that is accessible to laypeople, providing the perspective needed to understand and assess the foundations and predictions of climate change.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>“Brilliant and fundamental, this is the necessary book about our prime global emergency. Here you’ll find the facts, the processes, the physics of our complex and changing climate, but delivered with eloquence and urgency. Lawrence Krauss writes with a clarity that transcends mere politics. Prose and poetry were never better bedfellows.” (Ian McEwan, Booker Prize-winning author of <i>Solar</i> and <i>Machines Like Me)</i></p> <p>\"The ideal book for understanding the science of global warming..at once elegant, rigorous, and timely.\" (Elizabeth Kolbert, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Sixth Extinction)</i></p> <p>“A brief, brilliant, and charming summary of what physicists know about climate change and how they learned it.” (Sheldon Glashow, Nobel Laureate in Physics, Metcalf Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Boston University)</p> <p>“The distinguished scientist Lawrence Krauss turns his penetrating gaze on the most pressing existential threat facing our world: climate change. It is brimming with information lucidly analysed. Such hope as there is lies in science, and a physicist of Dr. Krauss’s imaginative versatility is unusually qualified to offer it.” (Richard Dawkins, author of <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i> and <i>Science in the Soul)</i></p> <p>“Lucid and gripping, this study of the most severe challenge humans have ever faced leads the reader from the basic physics of climate change to recognition of the damage that humans have already caused and on to the prospects that lie ahead if we do not change course soon.” (Noam Chomsky, Laureate Professor, University of Arizona, author of <i>Internationalism or Extinction?)</i></p> <p>“Lawrence Krauss tells the story of climate change with erudition, urgency, and passion. It is our great good luck that one of our most brilliant scientists is also such a gifted writer. This book will change the way we think about the future.” (Jennifer Finney Boylan, author of <i>Good Boy</i> and <i>She’s Not There)</i></p> <p>“Everything on climate change that I’ve seen is either dumbed down and bossy or written for other climate scientists. I’ve been looking for a book that can let me, a layperson, understand the science. This book does just what I was looking for. It is important.” (Penn Jillette, Magician, author of <i>Presto!</i> and <i>God, No!)</i></p> <p>“The renowned physicist Lawrence Krauss makes the science behind one of the most important issues of our time accessible to all.” (Richard C. J. Somerville, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego)</p> <p>“Lawrence Krauss is a fine physicist, a talented writer, and a scientist deeply engaged with public affairs. His book deserves wide readership. The book’s eloquent exposition of the science and the threats should enlighten all readers and motivate them to an urgent concern about our planet’s future.” (Lord Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, former president of the Royal Society, author of <i>On the Future: Prospects for Humanity)</i></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title,&nbsp;the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. </b></p>";
