window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We are in the midst of a powerful psychedelic renaissance. After four decades of hibernation, the promise of the psychoactive 60s - that deeper self-awareness, achieved through reality-bending substances and practices, will lead to greater external harmony - is again gaining a major following. The signs are everywhere, from the influence of today's preeminent psychedelic thinker Daniel Pinchbeck, to the renewed interest in the legacy of Terence McKenna, and to the upsurge of collective, inclusive (and overtly tripped-out) cultural phenomena like the spectacle of Burning Man. </p> <p><i>The Psychedelic Experience</i>, created in the movement's early years by the prophetic shaman-professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert (Ram Dass), is a foundational text that serves as a model and a guide for all subsequent mind-expanding inquiries. In this wholly unique book, the authors provide an interpretation of an ancient sacred manuscript, The Tibetan Book of the Dead, from a psychedelic perspective. <i>The Psychedelic Experience</i> describes their discoveries in broadening spiritual consciousness through a combination of Tibetan meditation techniques and psychotropic substances. </p> <p>As sacred as the text it reflects, <i>The Psychedelic Experience</i> is a guidebook to the wilderness of mind and an indispensable resource from the founding fathers of psychedelia. </p>";
