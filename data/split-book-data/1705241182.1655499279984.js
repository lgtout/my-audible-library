window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new manifesto for cyberfeminism</b></p> <p>The divide between the digital and the real world no longer exists: we are connected all the time. How do we find out who we are within this digital era? Where do we create the space to explore our identity? How can we come together and create solidarity?</p> <p>The glitch is often dismissed as an error, a faulty overlaying, but, as Legacy Russell shows, liberation can be found within the fissures between gender, technology and the body that it creates. The glitch offers the opportunity for us to perform and transform ourselves in an infinite variety of identities. In <i>Glitch Feminism</i>, Russell makes a series of radical demands through memoir, art and critical theory, and the work of contemporary artists who have traveled through the glitch in their work.</p> <p>Timely and provocative, <i>Glitch Feminism</i> shows how the error can be a revolution.</p>";
