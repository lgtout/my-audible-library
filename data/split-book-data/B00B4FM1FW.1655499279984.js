window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <br> <i>The Atlantic</i> • <i>The Huffington Post</i> • <i>Men’s Journal</i> • <i>MSN (U.K.)</i> • <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> • <i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>NUMBER ONE <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BEST SELLER • WINNER OF THE JAMES BEARD FOUNDATION AWARD FOR WRITING AND LITERATURE&nbsp;</p> <p>From a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter at <i>The New York Times</i> comes the explosive story of the rise of the processed food industry and its link to the emerging obesity epidemic. Michael Moss reveals how companies use salt, sugar, and fat to addict us and, more important, how we can fight back.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the spring of 1999, the heads of the world’s largest processed food companies gathered at Pillsbury headquarters in Minneapolis for a secret meeting. On the agenda: the emerging epidemic of obesity, and what to do about it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Increasingly, the salt-, sugar-, and fat-laden foods these companies produced were being linked to obesity, and a concerned Kraft executive took the stage to issue a warning: There would be a day of reckoning unless changes were made. When he was done, the most powerful person in the room - the CEO of General Mills - stood up to speak, clearly annoyed. And by the time he sat down, the meeting was over.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Salt Sugar Fat</i>, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how we got here. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century - including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestlé, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more - Moss’ explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research.&nbsp;</p> <p>Includes a bonus PDF with endnotes from the book&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
