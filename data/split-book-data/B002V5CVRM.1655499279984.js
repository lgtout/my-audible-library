window.bookSummaryJSON = "Based on the single largest neuromarketing study ever conducted, <i>Buyology</i> reveals surprising truths about what attracts our attention and captures our dollars. Among the long-held assumptions and myths Buyology confronts: <br> <li>Sex doesn't sell - people in skimpy clothing and provocative poses don't persuade us to buy products.<br></li> <li> Despite government bans, subliminal advertising is ubiquitous - from bars to supermarkets to highway billboards.<br></li> <li>Color can be so iconic that the sight of the robin's egg blue of a certain famous jewelry brand significantly raises women's heart rates.<br></li> <li> Companies shamelessly borrow from religion and ritual - like the ritual, made up by a bored American bartender, of drinking a Corona with a lime - to seduce our interest. <br></li> <li>\"Cool\" brands, like iPods, trigger our mating instincts. <p>The fact is, so much of what we thought we knew about why we buy is wrong. Drawing on a three-year, 7 million dollar, cutting-edge brain scan study of over 2000 people from around the world, marketing guru Martin Lindstrom's revelations will captivate anyone who's been seduced - or turned off - by marketer's relentless efforts to win our loyalty, our money and our minds.</p><p>Packed with entertaining stories about how we respond to such well-known products and companies as Marlboro, Calvin Klein, Ford, and American Idol, <i>Buyology</i> is a fascinating tour into the mind of today's consumer.</p></li>";
