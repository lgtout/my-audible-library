window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>As featured in the Ram Dass documentary film </b><b><i>Becoming Nobody,</i></b><b> five essential live teaching sessions on audio, presented here in their entirety</b></p> <p>\"The game is not about becoming somebody, it’s about becoming nobody.\" (Ram Dass)&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’re a spiritual explorer of any age or tradition, chances are you’ve heard of Ram Dass. This singular luminary began his “somebody training” as Richard Alpert - the 1960’s Harvard-psychologist-turned-hippie who tripped with Timothy Leary, befriended beat poets and Tibetan lamas, found his lifelong guru in India, and wrote the perennial classic <i>Be Here Now</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s the “somebody” part of his story. But for those who’ve experienced Ram Dass live as he shares his insights and personal journey on the way to becoming <i>nobody</i> - he has been for many the spark that ignited them to the liberating truth of who we really are.&nbsp;</p> <p>This audio collection brings us five essential sessions, featured in the Ram Dass documentary film <i>Becoming Nobody,</i> presented here in their entirety. Each beautifully illuminates a core dimension of Ram Dass’s wisdom. Through teaching stories, true accounts, eye-opening revelations, and his one-of-a-kind sense of humor, this legendary teacher helps show us the way out of the prison of our self-identity - and into the joy of being at once “nobody” and the universal divine at play in the world.</p>";
