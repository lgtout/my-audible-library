window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of </b><b><i>American Prometheus</i></b><b> comes the first effort to set the Cuban Missile Crisis, with its potential for nuclear holocaust, in a wider historical narrative of the Cold War — how such a crisis arose, and why at the very last possible moment it didn't happen.</b></p> <p>In this groundbreaking look at the Cuban Missile Crisis, Martin Sherwin not only gives us a riveting sometimes hour-by-hour explanation of the crisis itself, but also explores the origins, scope, and consequences of the evolving place of nuclear weapons in the post-World War II world. Mining new sources and materials, and going far beyond the scope of earlier works on this critical face-off between the United States and the Soviet Union — triggered when Khrushchev began installing missiles in Cuba at Castro's behest — Sherwin shows how this volatile event was an integral part of the wider Cold War and was a consequence of nuclear arms.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Gambling with Armageddon </i>looks in particular at the original debate in the Truman Administration about using the Atomic Bomb; the way in which President Eisenhower relied on the threat of massive retaliation to project US power in the early Cold War era; and how President Kennedy, though unprepared to deal with the Bay of Pigs debacle, came of age during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Here too is a clarifying picture of what was going on in Khrushchev's Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p> <p>Martin Sherwin has spent his career in the study of nuclear weapons and how they have shaped our world<i>. Gambling with Armegeddon</i> is an outstanding capstone to his work thus far.</p>";
