window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Coming home from the war in Iraq, US Army private Roy Scranton thought he'd left the world of strife behind. Then he watched as new calamities struck America, heralding a threat far more dangerous than ISIS or al-Qaeda: Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, megadrought - the shock and awe of global warming. </p> <p>Our world is changing. Rising seas, spiking temperatures, and extreme weather imperil global infrastructure, crops, and water supplies. Conflict, famine, plagues, and riots menace from every quarter. From war-stricken Baghdad to the melting Arctic, human-caused climate change poses a danger not only to political and economic stability but to civilization itself...and to what it means to be human. Our greatest enemy, it turns out, is ourselves. The warmer, wetter, more chaotic world we now live in - the Anthropocene - demands a radical new vision of human life. </p> <p>In this bracing response to climate change, Roy Scranton combines memoir, reportage, philosophy, and Zen wisdom to explore what it means to be human in a rapidly evolving world, taking listeners on a journey through street protests, the latest findings of earth scientists, a historic UN summit, millennia of geological history, and the persistent vitality of ancient literature. Expanding on his influential <i>New York Times</i> essay (the number-one most-emailed article the day it appeared, and selected for <i>Best American Science and Nature Writing</i> 2014), Scranton responds to the existential problem of global warming by arguing that in order to survive, we must come to terms with our mortality. </p> <p>Plato argued that to philosophize is to learn to die. If that's true, says Scranton, then we have entered humanity's most philosophical age - for this is precisely the problem of the Anthropocene. The trouble now is that we must learn to die not as individuals but as a civilization. </p> <p>Roy Scranton has published in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Boston Review</i>, and <i>Theory and Event</i> and has been interviewed on NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i>, among other media. </p>";
