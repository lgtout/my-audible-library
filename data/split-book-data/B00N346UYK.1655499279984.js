window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Influence: Science and Practice</i> is an examination of the psychology of compliance (i.e. uncovering which factors cause a person to say \"yes\" to another's request). </p> <p>Written in a narrative style combined with scholarly research, Cialdini combines evidence from experimental work with the techniques and strategies he gathered while working as a salesperson, fundraiser, advertiser, and in other positions inside organizations that commonly use compliance tactics to get us to say \"yes.\" Widely used in classes, as well as sold to people operating successfully in the business world, the eagerly awaited revision of <i>Influence</i> reminds the listener of the power of persuasion. </p> <p>Cialdini organizes compliance techniques into six categories based on psychological principles that direct human behavior: reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity.</p>";
