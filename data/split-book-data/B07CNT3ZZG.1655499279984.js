window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This timely reissue of Richard Hofstadter's classic work on the fringe groups that influence American electoral politics offers an invaluable perspective on contemporary domestic affairs. In <i>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</i>, acclaimed historian Richard Hofstadter examines the competing forces in American political discourse and how fringe groups can influence - and derail - the larger agendas of a political party.&nbsp;</p> <p>He investigates the politics of the irrational, shedding light on how the behavior of individuals can seem out of proportion with actual political issues, and how such behavior impacts larger groups. With such other classic essays as \"Free Silver and the Mind of 'Coin' Harvey\" and \"What Happened to the Antitrust Movement?\", <i>The Paranoid Style in American Politics</i> remains both a seminal text of political history and a vital analysis of the ways in which political groups function in the United States.</p>";
