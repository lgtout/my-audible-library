window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Since the Truman administration, America has been one \"push of a button\" away from nuclear war - a decision that rests solely in the hands of the president. Without waiting for approval from Congress or even the secretary of defense, the president can unleash America's entire nuclear arsenal.&nbsp;</p> <p>From authors William J. Perry, secretary of defense in the Clinton administration, and Tom Z. Collina, the director of policy at Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation in Washington, DC, <i>The Button</i> recounts the terrifying history of nuclear launch authority, from the faulty 46-cent microchip that nearly caused World War III to president Trump's tweet about his \"much bigger &amp; more powerful\" button. Perry and Collina share their firsthand experience on the front lines of the nation's nuclear history and provide illuminating interviews with former president Bill Clinton, former secretary of defense Jim Mattis, Congressman Adam Smith, Nobel Peace Prize winner Beatrice Fihn, senior Obama administration officials, and many others.&nbsp;</p> <p>Written in an accessible and authoritative voice, <i>The Button</i> reveals the shocking tales and sobering facts of nuclear executive authority throughout the atomic age, delivering a powerful condemnation against ever leaving explosive power this devastating under any one person's thumb.</p>";
