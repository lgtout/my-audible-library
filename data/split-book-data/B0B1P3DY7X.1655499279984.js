window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For more than two hundred years, disturbances of the mind—the sorts of things that were once called \"madness\"—have been studied and treated by the medical profession. Mental illness, some insist, is a disease like any other, whose origins can be identified and from which one can be cured. But is this true?&nbsp;</p> <p>In this masterful account of America's quest to understand and treat everything from anxiety to psychosis, one of the most provocative thinkers writing about psychiatry today sheds light on its tumultuous past. <i>Desperate Remedies</i> brings together a galaxy of mind doctors working in and out of institutional settings.</p> <p>Andrew Scull begins with the birth of the asylum in the reformist zeal of the 1830s and carries us through to the latest drug trials and genetic studies. He carefully reconstructs the rise and fall of state-run mental hospitals to explain why so many of the mentally ill are now on the street and why so many of those whose bodies were experimented on were women.</p> <p>Carefully researched, <i>Desperate Remedies</i> is a definitive account of America's long battle with mental illness that challenges us to rethink our deepest assumptions about who we are and how we think and feel.</p>";
