window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michael S. Gazzaniga, \"the father of cognitive neuroscience\", gives us an exciting behind-the-scenes look at his seminal work on the enigmatic coupling of the right and left brain. </p> <p>In the mid-20th century, Michael S. Gazzaniga made one of the great discoveries in the history of neuroscience: split-brain theory, the notion that the right and left hemispheres of the brain can act independently from each other and have different strengths. </p> <p>In <i>Tales from Both Sides of the Brain</i>, Gazzaniga tells the story of his passionate, entrepreneurial life in science and his decades-long journey to understand how the separate spheres of our brains communicate and miscommunicate their separate agendas. From his time as an ambitious undergraduate at Dartmouth, as a member of its now famed \"Animal House\" fraternity, and his life as a diligent graduate student in California to the first experiments he conducted in his own lab; from meeting his first split-brain patients to his collaboration with esteemed intellectuals across disciplines, Gazzaniga recounts the trajectory of his discoveries. In his engaging and accessible style, he paints a vivid portrait not only of his discovery of split-brain theory, but also of his comrades in arms - the many patients, friends, and family members who have accompanied him on this wild ride of intellectual discovery. </p> <p>By turns humorous and moving, <i>Tales from Both Sides of the Brain</i> uses an extraordinary discovery about the nature of human consciousness to tell an enthralling story of how science gets done.</p>";
