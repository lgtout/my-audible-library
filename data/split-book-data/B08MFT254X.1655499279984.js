window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Vladimir Lenin’s 1916 essay \"Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism\", is a synthesis of Lenin's development of economic theories that Karl Marx formulated in <i>Das Kapital</i>. It attempts to account for the increasing importance of the global market in the 20th century. Lenin contends that colonialism and the First World War were the consequences of the global spread of the capitalist economy.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the course of colonizing undeveloped countries, the Germans, British, French, and Russian empires would eventually clash over the economic exploitation of large portions of the globe. He argues that, in the capitalist homeland, the profits generated by the exploitation of colonies allow the business class to bribe native politicians, labor leaders, and the labor aristocracy in order to avoid worker revolts.</p>";
