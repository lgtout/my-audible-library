window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A riveting account of the five most crucial days in 20th-century diplomatic history: from Pearl Harbor to Hitler’s declaration of war on the United States.</b></p> <p>By early December 1941, war had changed much of the world beyond recognition. Nazi Germany occupied most of the European continent, while in Asia, the Second Sino-Japanese War had turned China into a battleground. But these conflicts were not yet inextricably linked - and the United States remained at peace.</p> <p><i>Hitler’s American Gamble</i> recounts the five days that upended everything: December 7 to 11. Tracing developments in real time and backed by deep archival research, historians Brendan Simms and Charlie Laderman show how Hitler’s intervention was not the inexplicable&nbsp;decision of a man so bloodthirsty that he forgot all strategy, but a calculated risk that can only be understood in a truly global context. This book reveals how December 11, not Pearl Harbor, was the real watershed that created a world war and transformed international history.</p>";
