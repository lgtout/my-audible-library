window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A fun and fascinating look at great scientific paradoxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout history, scientists have come up with theories and ideas that just don't seem to make sense. These we call paradoxes. The paradoxes Al-Khalili offers are drawn chiefly from physics and astronomy and represent those that have stumped some of the finest minds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For example, how can a cat be both dead and alive at the same time? Why will Achilles never beat a tortoise in a race, no matter how fast he runs? And how can a person be 10 years older than his twin?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With elegant explanations that bring the listener inside the mind of those who've developed them, Al-Khalili helps us to see that, in fact, paradoxes can be solved if seen from the right angle. Just as surely as Al-Khalili narrates the enduring fascination of these classic paradoxes, he reveals their underlying logic. In doing so, he brings to life a select group of the most exciting concepts in human knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Paradox </i>is mind-expanding fun.</p>";
