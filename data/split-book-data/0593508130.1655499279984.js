window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“A delightful, compelling book that offers a dazzling array of practical, thoughtful exercises designed to spark creativity, help solve problems, foster connection, and make our lives better.” (Gretchen Rubin, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author and host of the </b><b><i>Happier</i></b><b> podcast)</b></p> <p>In an era of ambiguous, messy problems - as well as extraordinary opportunities for positive change - it’s vital to have both an inquisitive mind and the ability to act with intention. <i>Creative Acts for Curious People</i> is filled with ways to build those skills with resilience, care, and confidence.&nbsp;</p> <p>At Stanford University’s world-renowned Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, a.k.a. “the d.school\", students and faculty, experts and seekers bring together diverse perspectives to tackle ambitious projects; this book contains the experiences designed to help them do it. A provocative and highly visual companion, it’s a definitive resource for people who aim to draw on their curiosity and creativity in the face of uncertainty. Teeming with ideas about discovery, learning, and leading the way through unknown creative territory, <i>Creative Acts for Curious People</i> includes memorable stories and more than 80 innovative exercises.&nbsp;</p> <p>Curated by executive director Sarah Stein Greenberg, after being honed in the classrooms of the d.school, these exercises originated in some of the world’s most inventive and unconventional minds, including those of d.school and IDEO founder David M. Kelley, <i>ReadyMade</i> magazine founder Grace Hawthorne, innovative choreographer Aleta Hayes, Google chief innovation evangelist Frederik G. Pferdt, and many more.&nbsp;</p> <p>To bring fresh approaches to any challenge - world changing or close to home - you can draw on exercises such as <i>Expert Eyes</i> to hone observation skills, <i>How to Talk to Strangers</i> to foster understanding, and <i>Designing Tools for Teams</i> to build creative leadership. The activities are at once lighthearted, surprising, tough, and impactful - and reveal how the hidden dynamics of design can drive more vibrant ways of making, feeling, exploring, experimenting, and collaborating at work and in life. This book will help you develop the behaviors and deepen the mindsets that can turn your curiosity into ideas, and your ideas into action.</p> <p><b>Includes a downloadable PDF for printing of key exercises from the book </b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
