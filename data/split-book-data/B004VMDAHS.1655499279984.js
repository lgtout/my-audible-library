window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sparking a flurry of heated debate, Hannah Arendt's authoritative and stunning report on the trial of German Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann first appeared as a series of articles in <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1963. This revised edition includes material that came to light after the trial, as well as Arendt's postscript directly addressing the controversy that arose over her account. A major journalistic triumph by an intellectual of singular influence, <i>Eichmann in Jerusalem</i> is as shocking as it is informative - an unflinching look at one of the most unsettling (and unsettled) issues of the 20th century.</p>";
