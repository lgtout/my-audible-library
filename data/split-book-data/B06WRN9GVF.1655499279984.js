In this fascinating new audiobook, Manoush explains the connection between boredom and original thinking, exploring how we can harness boredom's hidden benefits to become our most productive and creative selves, without totally abandoning our gadgets in the process. </p> <p>Grounding her arguments in the neuroscience and cognitive psychology of \"mind wandering\" - what our brains do when we're doing nothing at all - Manoush includes practical steps you can take to ease the nonstop busyness and enhance your ability to dream, wonder, and gain clarity in your work and life. The outcome is mind-blowing. </p>";
