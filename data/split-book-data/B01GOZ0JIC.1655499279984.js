window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Scientists' understanding of life is progressing more rapidly than at any point in human history, from the extraordinary decoding of DNA to the controversial emergence of biotechnology. Featuring pioneering biologists, geneticists, physicists, and science writers, <i>Life</i> explains just how far we've come - and takes a brilliantly educated guess at where we're heading. Richard Dawkins and J. Craig Venter compare genes to digital information and sketch the frontiers of genomic research. Edward O. Wilson reveals what ants can teach us about building a superorganism - and, in turn, about how cells build an organism. Elsewhere, David Haig reports new findings on how mothers and fathers individually influence the human genome while Kary Mullis covers cutting-edge treatments for dangerous viruses. And there's much more in this fascinating volume. </p> <p>We may never have all the answers. But the thinkers collected in <i>Life</i> are asking questions that will keep us dreaming for generations. </p>";
