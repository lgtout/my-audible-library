window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A crusading Mexican American journalist searches for justice and hope in an increasingly violent Mexico.</p> <p>In the last decade, more than 100,000 people have been killed or disappeared in the Mexican drug war, and drug trafficking there is a multibillion-dollar business. In a country where the powerful are rarely scrutinized, noted Mexican American journalist Alfredo Corchado refuses to shrink from reporting on government corruption, murders in Juarez, or the ruthless drug cartels of Mexico. One night, Corchado received a tip that he could be the next target of the Zetas, a violent paramilitary group - and that he had 24 hours to find out if the threat was true.</p> <p><i>Midnight in Mexico </i>is the story of one man's quest to report the truth of his country - as he races to save his own life.</p>";
