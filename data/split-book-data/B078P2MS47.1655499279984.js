window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The untold story of the heretical thinkers who dared to question the nature of our quantum universe</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Every physicist agrees quantum mechanics is among humanity's finest scientific achievements. But ask what it means, and the result will be a brawl. For a century, most physicists have followed Niels Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation and dismissed questions about the reality underlying quantum physics as meaningless. A mishmash of solipsism and poor reasoning, Copenhagen endured, as Bohr's students vigorously protected his legacy, and the physics community favored practical experiments over philosophical arguments. As a result, questioning the status quo long meant professional ruin.</p> <p>And yet, from the 1920s to today, physicists like John Bell, David Bohm, and Hugh Everett persisted in seeking the true meaning of quantum mechanics. <i>What Is Real?</i> is the gripping story of this battle of ideas and the courageous scientists who dared to stand up for truth.</p>";
