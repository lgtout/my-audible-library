window.bookSummaryJSON = "In <i>Inhuman Bondage</i>, David Brion Davis sums up a lifetime of insight, beginning with the dramatic Amistad case. He looks at slavery in the American South, describing black slaveholding planters; the rise of the Cotton Kingdom; the daily life of ordinary slaves; the highly destructive internal long-distance slave trade; the sexual exploitation of slaves; the emergence of an African-American culture; and much more. A definitive history by a writer deeply immersed in the subject, <i>Inhuman Bondage</i> links together the profits of slavery, the pain of the enslaved, and the legacy of racism. <p> David Brion Davis is recognized as the leading authority on slavery in the Western world. His books have won such awards as the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.</p>";
