window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This wise, stirring book argues that the search for meaning can immeasurably deepen our lives and is far more fulfilling than the pursuit of personal happiness.</b> </p> <p>There is a myth in our culture that the search for meaning is some esoteric pursuit - that you have to travel to a distant monastery or page through dusty volumes to figure out life's great secret. The truth is, there are untapped sources of meaning all around us - right here, right now. Drawing on the latest research in positive psychology; on insights from George Eliot, Viktor Frankl, Aristotle, the Buddha, and other great minds; and on interviews with seekers of meaning, Emily Esfahani Smith lays out the four pillars upon which meaning rests. </p> <p><b>Belonging</b>: We all need to find our tribe and forge relationships in which we feel understood, recognized, and valued - to know we matter to others. </p> <p><b>Purpose</b>: We all need a far-reaching goal that motivates us, serves as the organizing principle of our lives, and drives us to make a contribution to the world. </p> <p><b>Storytelling</b>: We are all storytellers, taking our disparate experiences and assembling them into a coherent narrative that allows us to make sense of ourselves and the world. </p> <p><b>Transcendence</b>: During a transcendent or mystical experience, we feel we have risen above the everyday world and are connected to something vast and meaningful. </p> <p>To bring those concepts to life, Smith visits a tight-knit fishing village on the Chesapeake Bay, stargazes in West Texas, attends a dinner where young people gather to share their experiences of untimely loss, and more. And she explores how we might begin to build a culture of meaning in our schools, our workplaces, and our communities. </p> <p>Inspiring and story-driven, <i>The Power of Meaning</i> will strike a profound chord in anyone seeking a richer, more satisfying life. </p>";
