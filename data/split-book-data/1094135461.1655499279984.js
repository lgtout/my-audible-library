window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Based off the original workbook, </b><b><i>Me and White Supremacy</i></b><b> teaches listeners how to dismantle the privilege within themselves so that they can stop (often unconsciously) inflicting damage on people of color, and in turn, help other white people do better, too. </b></p> <p>When Layla Saad began an Instagram challenge called #meandwhitesupremacy, she never predicted it would spread as widely as it did. She encouraged people to own up and share their racist behaviors, big and small. She was looking for truth, and she got it. Thousands of people participated in the challenge, and over 90,000 people downloaded the<i> Me and White Supremacy Workbook</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The updated and expanded <i>Me and White Supremacy </i>takes the work deeper by adding more historical and cultural contexts, sharing moving stories and anecdotes, and including expanded definitions, examples, and further resources.</p> <p>Awareness leads to action, and action leads to change. The numbers show that people are ready to do this work - let’s give it to them.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
