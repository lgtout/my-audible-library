window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Having a good, stable job used to be the bedrock of the American Dream. Not anymore. In this richly detailed and eye-opening audiobook, Rick Wartzman chronicles the erosion of the relationship between American companies and their workers. Through the stories of four major employers - General Motors, General Electric, Kodak, and Coca-Cola - he shows how big businesses once took responsibility for providing their workers and retirees with an array of social benefits. At the height of the post-World War II economy, these companies also believed that worker pay needed to be kept high in order to preserve morale and keep the economy humming. Productivity boomed.</p> <p>But the corporate social contract didn't last. By tracing the ups and downs of these four corporate icons over 70 years, Wartzman illustrates just how much has been lost: Job security and steadily rising pay, guaranteed pensions, robust health benefits, and much more. Charting the Golden Age of the '50s and '60s; the turbulent years of the '70s and '80s; and the growth of downsizing, outsourcing, and instability in the modern era, Wartzman's narrative is a biography of the American Dream gone sideways.</p> <p>Deeply researched and compelling, <i>The End of Loyalty</i> will make you rethink how Americans can begin to resurrect the middle class.</p> <p>Finalist for the<i> Los Angeles Times</i> book prize in current interest. A best business book of the year in economics, Strategy+Business.</p>";
