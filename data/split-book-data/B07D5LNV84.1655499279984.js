window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Award-winning entrepreneur and journalist Shane Snow reveals the counterintuitive reasons why so many partnerships and groups break down - and why some break through.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The best teams are more than the sum of their parts, but why does collaboration so often fail to fulfill this promise? In <i>Dream Teams</i>, Snow takes us on an adventure through history, neuroscience, psychology, and business, exploring what separates groups that simply get by together from those that get better together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>You'll learn:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>How ragtag teams - from soccer clubs to startups to gangs of pirates - beat the odds throughout history.&nbsp;</li> <li>Why Daimler Chrysler flopped while the Wu-Tang Clan succeeded, and the surprising factor behind most failed mergers, marriages, and partnerships.&nbsp;</li> <li>What the Wright Brothers' daily arguments can teach us about group problem solving.</li> <li>Pioneering women in law enforcement, unlikely civil rights collaborators, and underdog armies that did the incredible together.&nbsp;</li> <li>The team players behind great social movements in history, and the science of becoming open-minded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Provocative and entertaining, <i>Dream Teams</i> is a landmark work that will change the way we think about people, progress, and collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Includes a bonus PDF with an illustrated special afterword with Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant, the </b><b><i>Dream Teams </i></b><b>cheat sheet, and more.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
