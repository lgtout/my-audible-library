window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Eduardo Bonilla-Silva's acclaimed <i>Racism Without Racists</i> documents how, beneath our contemporary conversation about race, there lies a full-blown arsenal of arguments, phrases, and stories that whites use to account for - and ultimately justify - racial inequalities. The fifth edition of this provocative book makes clear that color-blind racism is as insidious now as ever. It features new material on our current racial climate, including the Black Lives Matter movement; a significantly revised chapter that examines the Obama presidency, the 2016 election, and Trump's presidency; and a new chapter addressing what listeners can do to confront racism - both personally and on a larger structural level. </p>";
