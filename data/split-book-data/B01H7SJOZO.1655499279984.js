window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The end of Communism and breakup of the Soviet Union was a time of euphoria around the world, but Russia today is violently anti-American and dangerously nationalistic. So how did we go from the promise of those days to the autocratic police state of Putin's new Russia? </p> <p><i>The Invention of Russia</i> reaches back to the darkest days of the Cold War to tell the story of the fight for the soul of a nation. With the deep insight only possible for a native son, Arkady Ostrovsky introduces us to the propagandists, oligarchs, and fixers who have set Russia's course since the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p> <p>The Soviet Union yoked together dreamers and strongmen - those who believed in an egalitarian ideal and those who pushed for an even more powerful state. The new Russia is a cynical operation where perpetual fear and war are fueled by a web of lies. Twenty-five years after the Soviet flag came down over the Kremlin, Russia and America are again heading toward a confrontation, but this course was far from inevitable. </p> <p>With this riveting account of how we got here - of the many mistakes and false promises - Ostrovsky emerges as Russia's most gifted chronicler. </p>";
