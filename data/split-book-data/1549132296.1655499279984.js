window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction</b></p> <p><b>Finalist for the Young Lions Fiction Award</b></p> <p><b>A Chinese American assassin sets out to rescue his kidnapped wife and exact revenge on her abductors in this </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Book Review Editors' Choice: a twist on the classic Western from \"an astonishing new voice\" (Jonathan Lethem).</b></p> <p>Orphaned young, Ming Tsu, the son of Chinese immigrants, is raised by the notorious leader of a California crime syndicate, who trains him to be his deadly enforcer. But when Ming falls in love with Ada, the daughter of a powerful railroad magnate, and the two elope, he seizes the opportunity to escape to a different life. Soon after, in a violent raid, the tycoon's henchmen kidnap Ada and conscript Ming into service for the Central Pacific Railroad.</p> <p>Battered, heartbroken, and yet defiant, Ming partners with a blind clairvoyant known only as the prophet. Together the two set out to rescue his wife and to exact revenge on the men who destroyed Ming, aided by a troupe of magic-show performers, some with supernatural powers, whom they meet on the journey. Ming blazes his way across the West, settling old scores with a single-minded devotion that culminates in an explosive and unexpected finale.</p> <p>Written with the violent ardor of Cormac McCarthy and the otherworldly inventiveness of Ted Chiang, <i>The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu</i> is at once a thriller, a romance, and a story of one man's quest for redemption in the face of a distinctly American brutality.</p> <p><b>\"In Tom Lin's novel, the atmosphere of Cormac McCarthy's West, or that of the Coen Brothers' </b><b><i>True Grit</i></b><b>, gives way to the phantasmagorical shades of Ray Bradbury, Charles Finney's </b><b><i>The Circus of Dr. Lao</i></b><b>, and Katherine Dunn's </b><b><i>Geek Love</i></b><b>. Yet </b><b><i>The Thousand Crimes of Ming Tsu</i></b><b> has a velocity and perspective all its own, and is a fierce new version of the Westward Dream.\" —Jonathan Lethem, author of </b><b><i>Motherless Brooklyn</i></b></p>";
