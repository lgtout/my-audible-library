But how does the brain create memories?</p> <p>Nobel Prize winner Eric R. Kandel intertwines the intellectual history of the powerful new science of the mind - a combination of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and molecular biology - with his own personal quest to understand memory.</p> <p>A deft mixture of memoir and history, modern biology and behavior, <i>In Search of Memory</i> brings listeners from Kandel's childhood in Nazi-occupied Vienna to the forefront of one of the great scientific endeavors of the 20th century: the search for the biological basis of memory.</p>";
