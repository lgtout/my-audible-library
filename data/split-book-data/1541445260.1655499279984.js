window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We are living in an age of heightened individualism. Success is a personal responsibility. Our culture tells us that to succeed is to be slim, rich, happy, extroverted, popular, and flawless. We have become self-obsessed. And our expectation of perfection comes at a cost. Millions are suffering under the torture of this impossible fantasy. The pressure to conform to this ideal has changed who we are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>It was not always like this. To explain how we got here, award-winning journalist Will Storr leads us on a \"terrific tour through the history of self-obsession\" (<i>NPR</i>, On Point) that explores the origins of this notion of the perfect self that torments so many of us: Where does this ideal come from? Why is it so powerful? Is there any way to break its spell?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Full of thrilling and unexpected connections among history, psychology, economics, neuroscience, and more, <i>Selfie</i> is an unforgettable book that makes sense of who we have become. Ranging from Ancient Greece, through the Christian Middle Ages, to the self-esteem evangelists of 1980s California, the rise of the \"selfie\" generation, and the era of hyper-individualism in which we live now, <i>Selfie</i> tells the epic tale of the person we all know so intimately - because it's us.</p>";
