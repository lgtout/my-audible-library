window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Master mythologist Martin Shaw uses story to examine our broken relationship with the world!</b></p> <p>Myth is our wild way of telling the truth, of sharing stories that have our living earth speaking through them. There is an old insistence that we each have a twin we know nothing about. A wild, curious twin that was thrown out the window the night we were born, taking much of our energy with them.&nbsp;</p> <p>This story is a quest to find and court our wild twin, for they have something important to tell us. If there was something we were here to do in our few, brief years, we can be sure that the wild twin is holding the key.</p> <p>In <i>Courting the Wild Twin</i>, Martin Shaw, an accomplished storyteller and scholar of myth and oral tradition, explores two ancient myths concerned with the wild twin and shares how vital they are to our ability to confront challenges with purpose, courage and creativity.</p> <p>Myths are our secret weapon. They have a radical agency of beauty in our age of amnesia, an agency far beyond concept and polemic.</p>";
