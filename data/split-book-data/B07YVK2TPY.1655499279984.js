window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Aftershock</i> is about the real war against terror - the struggle for a world in which nobody lives in fear of atrocities perpetrated by human beings. Every day, people who push against violence and injustice or pull for peace and freedom must face their own fears. Many activists also must struggle with \"aftershock,\" the physical and emotional reverberations of frightening, horrifying, or otherwise traumatizing experiences endured in the course of their activism.&nbsp;</p> <p>This book is for aftershocked activists and their allies, as well as for people and organizations that practice high-risk activism. It includes practical tips for individuals, organizations, and communities, as well as information about how traumatic events affect our bodies and abilities.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Aftershock</i> explores the culture of trauma that people have created through our violent exploitation of the Earth, other animals, and one another. As long as we continue to perpetrate such violations, we will never fully heal our own traumatic injuries. This book, therefore, is for survivors of all kinds of trauma, for therapists who treat trauma, and for anyone who hopes to reduce the amount of terror in the world.</p>";
