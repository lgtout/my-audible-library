window.bookSummaryJSON = "Emotions matter. Whether negotiating with an angry boss or an outraged teenager, emotions can derail you. Properly treated, however, they can help you achieve the results you want. This audiobook shows you how. <p> In <i>Beyond Reason</i>, you will discover five \"core concerns\" that motivate people: appreciation, affiliation, autonomy, status, and role. You will learn how to use these core concerns to generate helpful emotions in yourself and in others. Armed with this knowledge, you can gauge the needs of another negotiator, set the emotional tone of discussion, and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.</p> <p> <i>Beyond Reason</i> clarifies the complicated \"fuzzy\" world of emotions and offers straightforward, practical advice. It builds on previous work of the Harvard Negotiation Project, the group that brought you the groundbreaking book <i>Getting to YES</i>. Now, in <i>Beyond Reason</i>, world renowned negotiator Roger Fisher teams up with psychologist Daniel Shapiro, expert on the emotional dimension of negotiation. They show you how to employ emotions to turn a disagreement, big or small, professional or personal, into an opportunity for mutual gain.</p> <p> Fresh, insightful, and relevant to any interaction, <i>Beyond Reason</i> is certain to become a lasting classic for dealing with anyone from family and friends to colleagues, customers, and employees.</p>";
