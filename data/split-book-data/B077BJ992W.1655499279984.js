window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This audiobook will change your life by showing you how life changes.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Why does happiness tend to get harder in your 40s? Why do you feel in a slump when you're successful? Where does this malaise come from, regardless of your gender, race, class or nationality? And, most importantly, will it ever end?&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing on cutting-edge research and dozens of stories about a diverse set of people, award-winning journalist Jonathan Rauch answers all these questions. He shows that from our 20s into our 40s, happiness follows a U-shaped trajectory, declining from the optimism of youth into what's often a long, low slump in middle age, before starting to rise again in our 50s - and then yielding unexpected contentment and wisdom.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dismissing the popular myth of the midlife crisis, Rauch shows that the \"happiness curve\" does not usually indicate a period of disruption or dysfunction. Nor is it the result of bad personal choices or lack of gratitude. He reveals that the slump is completely natural, serving a vital psychological and social purpose. By shifting priorities away from competition and toward compassion, it equips you with new tools for wisdom and gratitude. You'll develop new values and see a change in who you are.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Full of insights and data and featuring many ways to endure the slump and avoid its perils and traps, </b><b><i>The Happiness Curve</i></b><b> doesn't just show listeners the dark forest of midlife; it helps them find a path through the trees. It also shows how we can - and why we must - do more to help each other through the woods.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
