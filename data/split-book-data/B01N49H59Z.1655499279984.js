window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Thousands of books have been written about the latest and greatest diets that will help people lose weight and improve health. But a key element in any successful nutritional health program is a tried-and-true method that most people haven't thought about - yet it could be revolutionary for taking health to the next level. This ancient secret is fasting. </p> <p>Fasting is not about starving oneself. When done right, it's an incredibly effective therapeutic approach that produces amazing results regardless of diet plan. In fact, Toronto-based nephrologist Dr. Jason Fung has used a variety of fasting protocols with more than 1,000 patients, with fantastic success. In <i>The Complete Guide to Fasting</i>, he has teamed up with international best-selling author and veteran health podcaster Jimmy Moore to explain what fasting is really about, why it's so important, and how to fast in a way that improves health. Together, they make fasting as a therapeutic approach both practical and easy to understand. </p> <p><i>The Complete Guide to Fasting</i> explains: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Why fasting is actually good for health </li> <li>Who can benefit from fasting (and who won't) </li> <li>The history of fasting </li> <li>The various ways to fast: intermittent, alternate-day, and extended fasting </li> <li>What to expect when starting to fast </li> <li>How to track progress while fasting </li> <li>The weight loss effects of fasting </li> <li>How to ward off potential negative effects from fasting </li> </ul> <p></p>";
