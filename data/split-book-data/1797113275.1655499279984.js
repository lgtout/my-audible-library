window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the 2021 Audie Award</b></p> <p><b>“I will be forever changed by Edith Eger’s story.” —Oprah</b></p> <p><b>A practical and inspirational guide to stopping destructive patterns and imprisoning thoughts to find freedom and joy in life—now updated to address the challenges of the pandemic and a world in crisis.</b></p> <p>World renowned psychologist and internationally bestselling author Edith Eger’s powerful <i>New York Times</i> bestselling book <i>The Choice</i> told the story of her survival in the concentration camps, her escape, healing, and journey to freedom. Readers and listeners around the world wrote to tell her how <i>The Choice</i> moved them and inspired them to confront their own past and try to heal their pain. They asked her to write another, more prescriptive book. Eger’s second book, <i>The Gift</i>, expands on her message of healing and provides a hands-on guide that gently encourages listeners to change the thoughts and behaviors that may be keeping them imprisoned in the past.</p> <p>Eger explains that the worst prison she experienced is not the prison that Nazis put her in but the one she created for herself: the prison within her own mind. She describes the most pervasive imprisoning beliefs she has known—including fear, grief, anger, secrets, stress, guilt, shame, and avoidance—and the tools she has discovered to deal with these universal challenges. These lessons are offered through riveting and inspiring stories from her life and the lives of her patients.</p> <p>This new, revised edition of <i>The Gift</i> contains two new chapters that examine the invaluable insights and lessons Edie learned during the COVID-19 pandemic; a time she used to rediscover freedom even in lockdown and to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, including preparing and sharing meals with the ones we love. Edie includes recipes for some of her favorite dishes which have been updated and tested by her daughter Marianne Engle and explains how food can be a deep expression of love and connection.</p> <p>As listeners seek to find joy and some peace in these challenging times, Eger’s wisdom and heartfelt advice is as timely, and timeless, as ever and certain to resonate with Eger’s devoted listeners and those who have not yet found her transformational wisdom.</p> <p>Filled with empathy, insight, and humor, <i>The Gift</i> captures the vulnerability and common challenges we all face and provides encouragement and advice for breaking out of our personal prisons to find healing and greater joy in life.</p>";
