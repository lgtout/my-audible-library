window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In </b><b><i>Talking to My Daughter About the Economy</i></b><b>, activist Yanis Varoufakis, Greece’s former finance minister and the author of the international best seller </b><b><i>Adults in the Room</i></b><b>, pens a series of letters to his young daughter, educating her about the business, politics, and corruption of world economics.</b></p> <p>Yanis Varoufakis has appeared before heads of nations, assemblies of experts, and countless students around the world. Now, he faces his most important - and difficult - audience yet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Using clear language and vivid examples, Varoufakis offers a series of letters to his young daughter about the economy: how it operates, where it came from, how it benefits some while impoverishing others. Taking bankers and politicians to task, he explains the historical origins of inequality among and within nations, questions the pervasive notion that everything has its price, and shows why economic instability is a chronic risk. Finally, he discusses the inability of market-driven policies to address the rapidly declining health of the planet his daughter’s generation stands to inherit.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout this audiobook, Varoufakis wears his expertise lightly. He writes as a parent whose aim is to instruct his daughter on the fundamental questions of our age - and, through that knowledge, to equip her against the failures and obfuscations of our current system and point the way toward a more democratic alternative.</p>";
