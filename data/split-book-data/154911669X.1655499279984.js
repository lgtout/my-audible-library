window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of </b><b><i>On Tyranny </i></b><b>comes the definitive history of Hitler's and Stalin's wars against the civilians of Europe in World War II.</b></p> <p>Americans call the Second World War \"The Good War.\" But before it even began, America's wartime ally Josef Stalin had killed millions of his own citizens - and kept killing them during and after the war. Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At war's end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness.</p> <p><i>Bloodlands</i> is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, <i>Bloodlands</i> will be required listening for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.</p> <p><i>Bloodlands</i> won 12 awards including the Emerson Prize in the Humanities, a Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Leipzig Award for European Understanding, and the Hannah Arendt Prize in Political Thought. It has been translated into more than 30 languages, was named to 12 book-of-the-year lists, and was a best seller in six countries.&nbsp;</p>";
