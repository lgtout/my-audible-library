window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When his next-door neighbors in a quaint New England town suddenly pick up and move to a gated retired community in Florida called The Villages, Andrew Blechman is astonished by their stories, so he goes to investigate. Larger than Manhattan, with a golf course for every day of the month, two downtowns, its own newspaper, radio, and TV station, The Villages is a city of nearly 100,000 (and growing) missing only one thing: children.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the critically acclaimed <i>Leisureville</i>, Blechman delves into life in the senior utopia, offering a hilarious firsthand report on everything from ersatz nostalgia to the residents' surprisingly active sex lives. But this is more than just a romp through a retirement paradise; Blechman traces the history of the age-segregated retirement phenomenon, and travels to Arizona to show what has happened to the pioneering developments after decades of segregation.&nbsp;</p> <p>A fascinating blend of serious history, social commentary, and hilarious, engaging reportage, <i>Leisureville</i> is an important book on a major, underreported trend.</p>";
