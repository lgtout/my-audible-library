window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.\"</p> <p>Since Niels Bohr said this many years ago, quantum mechanics has only been getting more shocking. We now realize that it's not really telling us that \"weird\" things happen out of sight, on the tiniest level, in the atomic world: Rather, everything is quantum. But if quantum mechanics is correct, what seems obvious and right in our everyday world is built on foundations that don't seem obvious or right at all - or even possible.</p> <p>An exhilarating tour of the contemporary quantum landscape, <i>Beyond Weird </i>is a book about what quantum physics really means - and what it doesn't. Science writer Philip Ball offers an up-to-date, accessible account of the quest to come to grips with the most fundamental theory of physical reality, and to explain how its counterintuitive principles underpin the world we experience.</p>";
