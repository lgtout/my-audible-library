window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A high-ranking general's gripping insider account of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and how it all went wrong.</b> </p><p>Over a 35-year career, Daniel Bolger rose through the army infantry to become a three-star general, commanding in both theaters of the U.S. campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. He participated in meetings with top-level military and civilian players, where strategy was made and managed. At the same time, he regularly carried a rifle alongside rank-and-file soldiers in combat actions - unusual for a general. Now, as a witness to all levels of military command, Bolger offers a unique assessment of these wars, from 9/11 to the final withdrawal from the region. </p><p>Writing with hard-won experience and unflinching honesty, Bolger makes the firm case that in Iraq and in Afghanistan, we lost - but we didn't have to. Intelligence was garbled. Key decision makers were blinded by spreadsheets or theories. And at the root of our failure, we never really understood our enemy. <i>Why We Lost</i> is a timely, forceful, and compulsively listenable account of these wars from a fresh and authoritative perspective. </p>";
