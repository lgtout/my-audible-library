window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How did a libertine who lacks even the most basic knowledge of the Christian faith win 81 percent of the white evangelical vote in 2016? And why have white evangelicals become a presidential reprobate's staunchest supporters? These are among the questions acclaimed historian Kristin Kobes Du Mez asks in <i>Jesus and John Wayne</i>, which explains how white evangelicals have brought us to our fractured political moment.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Jesus and John Wayne</i> is a sweeping account of the last 75 years of white evangelicalism, showing how American evangelicals have worked for decades to replace the Jesus of the Gospels with an idol of rugged masculinity and Christian nationalism. Evangelical popular culture is teeming with muscular heroes - mythical warriors and rugged soldiers, men like Oliver North, Ronald Reagan, Mel Gibson, and the <i>Duck Dynasty</i> clan, who assert white masculine power in defense of \"Christian America.\" Chief among these evangelical legends is John Wayne, an icon of a lost time when men were uncowed by political correctness, unafraid to tell it like it was, and did what needed to be done.&nbsp;</p> <p>A much-needed reexamination, <i>Jesus and John Wayne</i> explains why evangelicals have rallied behind the least-Christian president in American history and how they have transformed their faith in the process, with enduring consequences for all of us.</p>";
