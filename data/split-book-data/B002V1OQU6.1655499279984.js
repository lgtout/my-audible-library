window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Ecological Intelligence</i> recasts the uproar over global warming and the assault of man-made toxins into our bodies in terms of the collective self-deception which both created this crisis and holds a key to its solution. <p><i>Ecological Intelligence</i> argues that \"green\" labels and recycling programs may do more harm than good by feeding a vital lie, lulling us into the illusion that we are doing enough already while ignoring the adverse impact of the far vaster proportion of what we buy and do.</p> <p>The book brings a psychologist's insights into the world of commerce, arguing for radical transparency - tracking every substantial impact over the life cycle of an item, from manufacture to daily use, to disposal - and surfacing those impacts at the point of purchase. The movement toward such transparency augurs a day when the free market will operate in public interest.</p>";
