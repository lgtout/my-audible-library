window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“The world needs this book.” —Brené Brown, Ph.D., </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Dare to Lead </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> Atlas of the Heart</i></b></p> <p><b>An instant </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller</b></p> <p><b>As featured in </b><b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b></p> <p><b>Named a Must Read of 2022 by Forbes, Newsweek, and Goodreads</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>From the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of </b><b><i>When</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Drive</i></b><b>,&nbsp;a new book about the transforming power of our most misunderstood yet potentially most valuable emotion: regret.</b></p> <p>Everybody has regrets, Daniel H. Pink explains in <i>The Power of Regret</i>. They’re a universal and healthy part of being human. And understanding how regret works can help us make smarter decisions, perform better at work and school, and bring greater meaning to our lives.</p> <p>Drawing on research in social psychology, neuroscience, and biology,&nbsp;Pink debunks the myth of the “no regrets” philosophy of life. And using the&nbsp;largest sampling of American attitudes about regret ever conducted as well as his own World Regret Survey—which has collected regrets from more than 15,000 people in 105 countries—he lays out the four core regrets that each of us has. These deep regrets offer compelling insights into how we live and how we can find a better path forward.</p> <p>As he did in his bestsellers <i>Drive, When,</i> and <i>A Whole New Mind,</i> Pink lays out a dynamic new way of thinking about regret and frames his ideas in ways that are clear, accessible, and pragmatic. Packed with true stories of people's regrets as well as practical takeaways for reimagining regret as a positive force, <i>The Power of Regret</i> shows how we can live richer, more engaged lives.</p>";
