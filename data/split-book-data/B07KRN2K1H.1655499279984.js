window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With a foreword read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>Worldwide, depression will be the single biggest cause of disability in the next 20 years. But treatment for it has not changed much in the last three decades. In the world of psychiatry, time has apparently stood still...until now, with Edward Bullmore's </b><b><i>The Inflamed Mind: A Radical New Approach to Depression</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>In this game-changing audiobook, University of Cambridge profressor of psychiatry Edward Bullmore reveals the breakthrough new science on the link between depression and inflammation of the body and brain. He explains how, and why, we now know that mental disorders can have their root cause in the immune system and outlines a future revolution in which treatments could be specifically targeted to break the vicious cycles of stress, inflammation, and depression.</p> <p><i>The Inflamed Mind</i> goes far beyond the clinic and the lab, representing a whole new way of looking at how mind, brain, and body all work together in a sometimes misguided effort to help us survive in a hostile world. It offers insights into how we could start getting to grips with depression and other mental disorders much more effectively in the future.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
