window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Find the fully revised and updated edition of </b><b><i>Radical Candor</i></b><b> on Audible.</b></p> <p>Now a <i>New York Times</i> best seller&nbsp;</p> <p>This program is read by the author.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the time we learn to speak, we're told that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. When you become a manager, it's your job to say it - and your obligation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Author Kim Scott was an executive at Google and then at Apple, where she developed a class on how to be a good boss. She has earned growing fame in recent years with her vital new approach to effective management, <i>Radical Candor</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Radical Candor</i> is a simple idea: to be a good boss, you have to Care Personally at the same time that you Challenge Directly. When you challenge without caring its obnoxious aggression; when you care without challenging its ruinous empathy. When you do neither its manipulative insincerity.&nbsp;</p> <p>This simple framework can help you build better relationships at work, and fulfill your three key responsibilities as a leader: creating a culture of feedback (praise and criticism), building a cohesive team, and achieving results you're all proud of.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Radical Candor</i> offers a guide to those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who manage bosses. Taken from years of the author's experience, and distilled clearly giving actionable lessons to the listener; it shows managers how to be successful while retaining their humanity, finding meaning in their job, and creating an environment where people both love their work and their colleagues.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
