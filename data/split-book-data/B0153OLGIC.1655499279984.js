window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Saving Capitalism</i>, Robert Reich reveals the entrenched cycles of power and influence that have damaged American capitalism, perpetuating a new oligarchy in which the 1 percent get ever richer and the rest - middle and working class alike - lose ever more economic agency, making for the greatest income inequality and wealth disparity since World War II. In brilliantly provocative detail, he shows how our misguided veneration of the \"free market\" has led us here and offers an empowering call to civic action as well as specific ideas for reform. A former White House advisor, talk show fixture, lecturer, and essayist and the star of last year's acclaimed documentary <i>Inequality for All</i>, Robert Reich is a beloved ambassador of progressive economics and a voice of reason in a media climate of fear mongering and finger pointing. </p>";
