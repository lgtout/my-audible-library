window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A collection of essays by 15 philosophers presenting a thoughtful, introductory guide to choosing a philosophy for living an examined and meaningful life. A Vintage original</b></p> <p>Socrates famously said \"the unexamined life is not worth living,\" but what does it mean to truly live philosophically?</p> <p>This thought-provoking, wide-ranging collection brings together essays by 15 leading philosophers reflecting on what it means to live according to a philosophy of life. From Eastern philosophies (Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism) and classical Western philosophies (such as Aristotelianism and Stoicism), to the four major religions, as well as contemporary philosophies (such as existentialism and effective altruism), each contributor offers a lively, personal account of how they find meaning in the practice of their chosen philosophical tradition.</p> <p>Together, the pieces in <i>How to Live a Good Life</i> provide not only a beginner's guide to choosing a life philosophy but also a timely portrait of what it means to live an examined life in the 21st century.</p>";
