window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Maxed Out</i> exposes the recent history and culture of debt for all of its absurdities and contradictions. From the gilded, master-planned communities of northern Las Vegas to America's Deep South and inner cities, the world's largest financial institutions are trolling for customers - from the nouveau riche to the poorest members of society, who counter-intuitively make for the largest profits.<p> Another profitable group can be found in and around our nation's universities, where credit-card issuers are forming \"partnerships\" with colleges: paying them millions of dollars for access to their students' personal information and essentially setting kids up for financial ruin.</p><p> <i>Maxed Out</i> examines an industry that thrives on making people fail, then pursues them relentlessly to death's door. The industry's frontier is called \"debt buying\" and it's a veritable Wild West in which young men are hoping to make vast fortunes off of the misery and misfortune of others. Their tool is a vast trove of personal information that can be bought for next to nothing - as well as intimidation, guilt, and fear.</p><p> By turns hilarious, fascinating, and deeply disturbing, <i>Maxed Out</i> is ultimately one observer's answer to the question, \"Why can't we get out of debt?\"</p>";
