window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Good luck isn't just chance - it can be learned and leveraged - and </b><b><i>The Serendipity Mindset </i></b><b>explains how you can use serendipity to make life better at work, at home - everywhere.</b></p> <p>Many of us believe that the great turning points and opportunities in our lives happen by chance, that they're out of our control. Often we think that successful people - and successful companies and organizations - are simply luckier than the rest of us. Good fortune - serendipity - just seems to happen to them.</p> <p>Is that true? Or are some people better at creating the conditions for coincidences to arise and taking advantage of them when they do? How can we connect the dots of seemingly random events to improve our lives?</p> <p>In <i>The Serendipity</i> <i>Mindset</i>, Christian Busch explains that serendipity isn't about luck in the sense of simple randomness. It's about seeing links that others don't, combining these observations in unexpected and strategic ways, and learning how to detect the moments when apparently random or unconnected ideas merge to form new opportunities. Busch explores serendipity from a rational and scientific perspective and argues that there are identifiable approaches we can use to foster the conditions to let serendipity grow.</p> <p>Drawing from biology, chemistry, management, and information systems, and using examples of people from all walks of life, Busch illustrates how serendipity works and explains how we can train our own serendipity muscle and use it to turn the unexpected into opportunity. Once we understand serendipity, Busch says, we become curators of it, and luck becomes something that no longer just happens to us - it becomes a force that we can grasp, shape, and hone.&nbsp;</p> <p>Full of exciting ideas and strategies, <i>The Serendipity Mindset </i>offers a clear blueprint for how we can cultivate serendipity to increase innovation, influence, and opportunity in every aspect of our lives.</p>";
