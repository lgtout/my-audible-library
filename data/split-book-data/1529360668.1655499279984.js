window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A response to the woeful inadequacy of male leadership and an investigation into the qualities demonstrated by the female leaders showing us how it's done. Including original research and interviews with Madeleine Albright, Mary Robinson, Alicia Garza and many others.</b></p> <p>The first two decades of the 21st century have seen financial collapse, a global pandemic, the devastation of our environment and the disintegration of democracies. But while some at the top are telling us 'it is what is it', there's a new generation of leaders showing the world how to be better. They're building trust, investing wisely and acting decisively. And they've got one thing in common.</p> <p>Women have been taught to 'lean in' and act like men to get ahead. But as the financial, environmental and social systems crumble, isn't it time we had a different plan?&nbsp;</p> <p>And most importantly, what can women in power teach all of us about leadership?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
