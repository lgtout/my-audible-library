They don’t want to just point out how powerfully we are influenced by our perspectives and prejudices—our frames. They want to show us that these frames are tools, and that we can optimise their use.” (</b><b><i>Forbes</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>From pandemics to populism, AI to ISIS, wealth inequity to climate change, humanity faces unprecedented challenges that threaten our very existence.&nbsp;The essential tool that will enable humanity to find the best way foward is defined in <i>Framers</i> by internationally renowned authors Kenneth Cukier, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, and Francis de Véricourt.&nbsp;</p> <p>To frame is to make a mental model that enables us to make sense of new situations. Frames guide the decisions we make and the results we attain. People have long focused on traits like memory and reasoning, leaving framing all but ignored. But with computers becoming better at some of those cognitive tasks, framing stands out as a critical function - and only humans can do it. This book is the first guide to mastering this human ability.&nbsp;</p> <p>Illustrating their case with compelling examples and the latest research, authors Cukier, Mayer-Schönberger, and de Véricourt examine:</p> <ul> <li>Why advice to “think outside the box” is useless</li> <li>How Spotify beat Apple by reframing music as an experience</li> <li>How the #MeToo twitter hashtag reframed the perception of sexual assault</li> <li>The disaster of framing Covid-19 as equivalent to seasonal flu, and how framing it akin to SARS delivered New Zealand from the pandemic</li> </ul> <p><i>Framers</i> shows how framing is not just a way to improve how we make decisions in the era of algorithms - but why it will be a matter of survival for humanity in a time of societal upheaval and machine prosperity.</p>";
