window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This program is read by the author and includes material recorded in front of a live audience.&nbsp;</p> <p>An honest, irreverent, laugh-out-loud audiobook guide to coping with death and dying from the Emmy-nominated writer and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling coauthor of <i>Sh*tty Mom</i>, Laurie Kilmartin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Death is not for the faint of heart, and sometimes the best way to cope is through humor. No one knows this better than comedian Laurie Kilmartin. She made headlines by live-tweeting her father's time in hospice and her grieving process after he passed and channeled her experience into a comedy special, <i>45 Jokes About My Dead Dad</i>. <i>Dead People Suck</i> is her hilarious guide to surviving (sometimes) death, dying, and grief without losing your mind. Whether you are old and about to die, sick and about to die, or with a loved one who is about to pass away or who has passed away, there's something for you. With chapters like \"Are You an Old Man with Daughters? Please Shred Your Porn\", \"If Cancer Was an STD, It Would Be Cured by Now\", and \"Unsubscribing Your Dead Parent from Tea Party Emails\", Laurie Kilmartin guides listeners through some of life's most complicated moments with equal parts heart and sarcasm.</p>";
