window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What happens after Trump?&nbsp;</p> <p>This question, more than any other, will determine whether or not the movement to put America First and Make America Great Again succeeds.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his newest volume, Tom Kawczynski builds upon his knowledge of the past and analysis of the future to offer a pathway forward for America to realize even greater renewal in the embrace of unrepentant nationalism.&nbsp;</p> <p>Building the wall is but the first step as immigration and family planning policies are frankly discussed, the process through which nations are constructed is applied to revitalize our failing civic culture, and the first steps of what must be done for the future to ensure America does not revert to the dismal malaise of the Obama era.</p>";
