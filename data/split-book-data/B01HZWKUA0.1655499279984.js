window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With practical teachings and detailed instructions, Ken Wilber introduces <i>Integral Mindfulness</i>, a new way of practicing the widely popular meditation. <i>Integral Mindfulness</i> applies many of the leading-edge insights of Ken Wilber's Integral Theory - the first system to combine Eastern teachings on the five stages of awakening with the eight major Western models of human development, thus portraying the complete path of human evolution. In addition to all the benefits to body, mind, and spirit that standard mindfulness meditation confers, practicing Integral Mindfulness promises a more powerful approach to personal transformation and brings within reach the fullest experience of Enlightenment possible. </p> <p>Beginning with as little as 15 to 30 minutes of daily sessions, the meditator can gradually expand from there by slowly and easily adding significant aspects of the practice. Meditation instructions and step-by-step guided contemplations are given in detail. Listeners learn how to create a graph to track progress and discover natural strengths and potentials. The book also offers recommended readings and resources to facilitate further study. </p>";
