window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Don't just let influence just happen to you. Instead, take charge of your life by grasping the science behind how influence works and by strengthening your own skills at using it to your advantage. In this dynamic 12-lecture series, you'll discover how to tap into the hidden powers of influence - and use these powers to enhance your life in ways you never thought possible. </p> <p>Using clear and accessible language, Professor Brown teaches you how and why influence works. You'll explore the four key factors involved in influence attempts; delve into exciting psychological and sociological research and experiments; ponder the ethics surrounding influence by studying the lives of historical leaders (and despots); get solid tips for becoming more influential; and hone your skills with simple exercises for everyday living. By the final lecture, you'll be able to harness the power of influence at home, at work, at the store, in your social life, and anywhere else you may need it. </p>";
