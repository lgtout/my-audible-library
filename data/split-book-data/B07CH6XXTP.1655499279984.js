window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We all know the book: it's been hailed as one of the most important documents on how the world economy works, or doesn't work, and it's been a colossal bestseller since it first appeared in 2014, with more than 1.5 million copies sold. Thomas Piketty's <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i> makes a powerful case that wealth, and accumulated wealth, tends to stay where it lands: and with the passage of time, just gets bigger…and bigger.&nbsp;</p> <p>But how many of us who bought or borrowed the book - or even, perhaps, reviewed it - have read more than a fraction of its 696 pages? How many more shuddered at the thought of committing $40 to such a venture? And how many of Piketty's groundshaking concepts have gone unappreciated, all for want of intellectual stamina?&nbsp;</p> <p>Deliverance is at hand in the form of Pocket Piketty, written in clear and accessible prose by an experienced economist and teacher - and one whose work was relied on by Piketty for his masterpiece. In this handy and slim volume, Jesper Roine explains all things Piketty.</p>";
