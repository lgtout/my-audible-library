window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A toxic ideology rules the world of extreme competition and individualism. It misrepresents human nature, destroying hope and common purpose. Only a positive vision can replace it, a new story that reengages people in politics and lights a path to a better world. </p> <p>George Monbiot shows how new findings in psychology, neuroscience and evolutionary biology cast human nature in a radically different light: as the supreme altruists and cooperators. He shows how we can build on these findings to create a new politics: a 'politics of belonging'. </p> <p>Both democracy and economic life can be radically reorganized from the bottom up, enabling us to take back control and overthrow the forces that have thwarted our ambitions for a better society. </p> <p>Urgent and passionate, <i>Out of the Wreckage</i> provides the hope and clarity required to change the world. </p>";
