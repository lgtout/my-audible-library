window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number one</b><b><i> New York Times </i></b><b>best seller&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>From the National Book Award-winning author of </b><b><i>Stamped from the Beginning</i></b><b> comes a “groundbreaking” (</b><b><i>Time</i></b><b>) approach to understanding and uprooting racism and inequality in our society - and in ourselves.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>“The most courageous book to date on the problem of race in the Western mind.” (<i>The New York Times</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Named One of the Best Books of the Year by: </b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><b> • </b><b><i>Time</i></b><b> • </b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b> •</b> <b><i>Shelf Awareness&nbsp;</i></b><b>• </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><b> • </b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b> <b><i> • Kirkus Reviews </i></b></p> <p>Antiracism is a transformative concept that reorients and reenergizes the conversation about racism - and, even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other. At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In<i> How to Be an Antiracist</i>, Kendi takes listeners through a widening circle of antiracist ideas - from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities - that will help listeners see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves.</p> <p>Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society.</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>How to Be an Antiracist </i></b></p> <p>“Ibram X. Kendi’s new book,&nbsp;<i>How to Be an Antiracist</i>,&nbsp;couldn’t come at a better time.... Kendi has gifted us with a book&nbsp;that is not only an essential instruction manual but also a memoir of the author’s own path from anti-Black racism to anti-white racism and, finally, to antiracism.... <i>How to Be an Antiracist</i>&nbsp;gives us a clear and compelling way to approach, as Kendi puts it in his introduction, ‘the basic struggle we’re all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.’” (NPR)&nbsp;</p> <p>“Kendi dissects why in a society where so few people consider themselves to be racist the divisions and inequalities of racism remain so prevalent.&nbsp;<i>How to Be an Antiracist</i>&nbsp;punctures the myths of a post-racial America, examining what racism really is - and what we should do about it.” (<i>Time</i>)</p>";
