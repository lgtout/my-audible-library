window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The classic, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling book on the psychology of racism that shows us how to talk about race in America.</p> <p>Walk into any racially mixed high school and you will see Black, White, and Latino youth clustered in their own groups. Is this self-segregation a problem to address or a coping strategy? How can we get past our reluctance to discuss racial issues?</p> <p>Beverly Daniel Tatum, a renowned authority on the psychology of racism, argues that straight talk about our racial identities is essential if we are serious about communicating across racial and ethnic divides and pursuing antiracism. These topics have only become more urgent as the national conversation about race is increasingly acrimonious. This fully revised edition is essential listening for anyone seeking to understand dynamics of race and racial inequality in America.</p>";
