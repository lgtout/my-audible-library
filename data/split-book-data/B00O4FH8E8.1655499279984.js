window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number one <i>New York Times</i> best seller</p> <p>A powerful true story about the potential for mercy to redeem us, and a clarion call to fix our broken system of justice - from one of the most brilliant and influential lawyers of our time, as seen in the HBO documentary&nbsp;<i>True Justice</i>.</p> <p>Soon to be a major motion picture starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx</p> <p>Named one of the Best Books of the Year by <i>The New York Times</i>,<i> The Washington Post</i>,<i> The Boston Globe</i>,<i> The Seattle Times</i>,<i> Esquire</i>, and<i> Time&nbsp;</i></p> <p>Bryan Stevenson was a young lawyer when he founded the Equal Justice Initiative, a legal practice dedicated to defending those most desperate and in need: the poor, the wrongly condemned, and women and children trapped in the farthest reaches of our criminal justice system. One of his first cases was that of Walter McMillian, a young man who was sentenced to die for a notorious murder he insisted he didn’t commit. The case drew Bryan into a tangle of conspiracy, political machination, and legal brinksmanship - and transformed his understanding of mercy and justice forever.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Just Mercy</i> is at once an unforgettable account of an idealistic, gifted young lawyer’s coming of age, a moving window into the lives of those he has defended, and an inspiring argument for compassion in the pursuit of true justice.</p> <p>Winner of the Carnegie Medal for Nonfiction</p> <p>Winner of the NAACP Image Award for Nonfiction</p> <p>Winner of a Books for a Better Life Award</p> <p>Finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize</p> <p>Finalist for the <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Prize</p> <p>An American Library Association Notable Book</p> <p>“Every bit as moving as <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, and in some ways more so...a searing indictment of American criminal justice and a stirring testament to the salvation that fighting for the vulnerable sometimes yields.” (David Cole, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>“Searing, moving... Bryan Stevenson may, indeed, be America’s Mandela.” (Nicholas Kristof, <i>The New York Times</i>)</p> <p>“You don’t have to read too long to start cheering for this man.... The message of this book...is that evil can be overcome, a difference can be made.<i> Just Mercy</i> will make you upset and it will make you hopeful.” (Ted Conover, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)</p> <p>“Inspiring... a work of style, substance and clarity... Stevenson is not only a great lawyer, he’s also a gifted writer and storyteller.” (<i>The Washington Post</i>)</p> <p>“As deeply moving, poignant and powerful a book as has been, and maybe ever can be, written about the death penalty.” (<i>The Financial Times</i>)</p> <p>“Brilliant.” (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)</p>";
