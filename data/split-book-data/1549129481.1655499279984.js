window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this groundbreaking audiobook, a leading clinical psychiatrist redefines how we think about and treat victims of trauma. A \"stunning achievement\" that remains a \"classic for our generation\" (Bessel van der Kolk, MD, author of </b><b><i>The Body Keeps the Score</i></b><b>). </b></p> <p><i>Trauma and Recovery</i> is revered as the seminal text on understanding trauma survivors. By placing individual experience in a broader political frame, Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman argues that psychological trauma is inseparable from its social and political context. Drawing on her own research on incest, as well as a vast literature on combat veterans and victims of political terror, she shows surprising parallels between private horrors like child abuse and public horrors like war.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as \"one of the most important psychiatry works to be published since Freud\", <i>Trauma and Recovery</i> is essential listening for anyone who seeks to understand how we heal and are healed.</p>";
