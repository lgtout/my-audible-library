window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>How four tools enabled humanity to control its destiny</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>What enabled us to go from simple stone tools to smartphones? How did bands of hunter-gatherers evolve into multinational empires? Listeners of <i>Sapiens</i> will say a cognitive revolution - a dramatic evolutionary change that altered our brains, turning primitive humans into modern ones - caused a cultural explosion. In <i>Transcendence</i>, Gaia Vince argues instead that modern humans are the product of a nuanced coevolution of our genes, environment, and culture that goes back into deep time. She explains how, through four key elements - fire, language, beauty, and time - our species diverged from the evolutionary path of all other animals, unleashing a compounding process that launched us into the Space Age and beyond. Provocative and poetic, <i>Transcendence</i> shows how a primate took dominion over nature and turned itself into something marvelous.</p>";
