window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Fox News medical analyst and the author of <i>False Alarm</i> (Wiley, 2008) comes <i>COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science</i> by Marc Siegel, MD. This shocking expose of the facts as the media covers the national pandemic news and spread of the invisible virus reinforces the notion that we must arm ourselves against fear tactics that limit our abilities to safely make decisions and protect our families in a world of uncertainty.</p> <p>Life for citizens of the developed world before the pandemic was safer, easier, and healthier than for any other people in history thanks to modern medicine, science, technology, and intelligence - but COVID-19 has stolen that security and our nation's peace of mind. Now there is a pandemic virus, as well as a crippling epidemic of fear sweeping America. Why? The answer, according to nationally renowned health commentator Dr. Marc Siegel, is that we already lived in an artificially created culture of fear that was just waiting to be unleashed. In <i>COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science</i>, Siegel identifies three major catalysts of the culture of fear - government, the media, and our own psyche. With fascinating, blow-by-blow analyses of the most sensational false alarms of the past few years, compounded now by the worst contagion of our lifetimes, he shows how fearmongers manipulate our most primitive instincts - often without our even realizing it. <i>COVID </i>shows us how to look behind the hype and hysteria, inoculate ourselves against these crippling fear tactics, and develop the emotional and intellectual skills needed to take back our lives even as we battle the pandemic itself.</p>";
