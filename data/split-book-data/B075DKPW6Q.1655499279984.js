window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"After years of debate and inquiry, the key to a great marriage remained shrouded in mystery. Until now....\" (Carol Dweck, author of </b><b><i>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</i></b><b>)</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Eli J. Finkel's insightful and ground-breaking investigation of marriage clearly shows that the best marriages today are better than the best marriages of earlier eras. Indeed, they are the best marriages the world has ever known. He presents his findings here for the first time in this lucid, inspiring guide to modern marital bliss.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The All-or-Nothing Marriage</i> reverse engineers fulfilling marriages - from the \"traditional\" to the utterly nontraditional - and shows how any marriage can be better.&nbsp;</p> <p>The primary functions of marriage from 1620 to 1850 were food, shelter, and protection from violence; from 1850 to 1965, the purpose revolved around love and companionship. But today, a new kind of marraige has emerged, one oriented toward self-discovery, self-esteem, and personal growth. Finkel combines cutting-edge scientific research with practical advice; he considers paths to better communication and responsiveness; he offers guidance on when to recalibrate our expectations; and he even introduces a set of must-try \"lovehacks\".&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a book for the newlywed to the empy nester, for those thinking about getting married or remarried, and for anyone looking for illuminating advice that will make a real difference to getting the most out of marriage today.&nbsp;</p> <p>Includes a PDF of Supplemental Images and Graphics&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
