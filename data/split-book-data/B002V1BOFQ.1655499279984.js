window.bookSummaryJSON = "This engrossing piece of undercover reportage has been a fixture on the <i>New York Times</i> best seller list since its publication. With nearly a million copies in print, <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> is a modern classic that deftly portrays the plight of America's working-class poor. <p>A successful author, Barbara Ehrenreich decides to see if she can scratch out a comfortable living in a blue-collar America obsessed with welfare \"reform\". Her first job is waitressing, which pulls in a measly $2.43 an hour plus tips. She moves around the country, trying her hand as a maid, a nursing home assistant, and a Wal-Mart salesperson. What she discovers is a culture of desperation, where workers take multiple thankless jobs just to keep a roof overhead.</p> <p>Often humorous and always illuminating, <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> is a remarkable expose of the ugly flip side of the American dream.</p>";
