window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Happiness expert Sonja Lyubomirsky’s research-based lessons in how to find opportunity in life’s thorniest moments.</b> </p> <p>In <i>The Myths of Happiness,</i> Sonja Lyubomirsky isolates the major turning points of adult life, looking to both achievements (marriage, children, professional satisfaction, wealth) and failures (singlehood, divorce, financial ruin, illness) to reveal that our misconceptions about the impact of such events is perhaps the greatest threat to our long-term well-being. </p> <p>Lyubomirsky argues that we have been given false promises - myths that assure us that lifelong happiness will be attained once we hit the culturally confirmed markers of adult success. This restricted view of happiness works to discourage us from recognizing the upside of any negative life turn and blocks us from recognizing our own growth potential. Our outsized expectations transform natural rites of passage into emotional land mines and steer us to make toxic decisions, as <i>The Myths of Happiness</i> reveals. </p> <p>Because we expect the best (or the worst) from life's turning points, we shortsightedly place too much weight on our initial emotional responses. <i>The Myths of Happiness</i> empowers listeners to look beyond their first response, sharing scientific evidence that often it is our mindset - not our circumstances - that matters. Central to these findings is the notion of hedonic adaptation, the fact that people are far more adaptable than they think. Even after a major life change - good or bad - we tend to return to our initial happiness level, forgetting what once made us elated or why we felt that life was so unbearable. </p> <p><i>The Myths of Happiness</i> offers the perspective we need to make wiser choices, sharing how to slow the effects of this adaptation after a positive turn and find the way forward in a time of darkness. </p> <p>In <i>The Myths of Happiness,</i> Sonja Lyubomirsky turns an empirical eye to the biggest, messiest moments, providing listeners with the clear-eyed vision they need to build the healthiest, most satisfying life. A corrective course on happiness and a call to regard life's twists and turns with a more open mind, <i>The Myths of Happiness</i> shares practical lessons with life-changing potential.</p>";
