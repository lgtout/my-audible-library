window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Think Away Your Pain</i> presents a revolutionary approach to relieve suffering and eliminate chronic pain. In this user-friendly clearly written book, you will learn how chronic pain becomes a condition of the brain as much as the body. <i>Think Away Your Pain</i> shows you how to use the immense power of your thoughts and beliefs to literally change the neural circuitry of your brain. Dr. Schechter combines scientific evidence with clinical experience and psychological insight to teach a systematic method to control and eliminate pain with the mind. With 25 years in the field, Dr. Schechter has cured thousands of patients with this mind/brain based program. This book teaches the TMS healing method where changing thought, expressing feelings, and understanding can and do change the neural circuitry of the brain and eliminate the pain. Dr. Schechter discusses research supporting this approach including research by the author. Some will find this a more contemporary version of John Sarno's books on this subject. Others will find this a fascinating interface between medicine, psychology, and neuroscience. For the chronic pain sufferer limited in function, distressed by suffering and hopeless about the future, this book offers realistic hope. </p>";
