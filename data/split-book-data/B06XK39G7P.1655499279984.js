window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A century of industrial development is the briefest of moments in the half billion years of the Earth's evolution. And yet our current era has brought greater changes to the Earth than any period in human history. The biosphere, the globe's life-giving envelope of air and climate, has been changed irreparably. In <i>A World to Live In</i>, the distinguished ecologist George Woodwell shows that the biosphere is now a global human protectorate and that its integrity of structure and function are tied closely to the human future. </p> <p>The earth is a living system, Woodwell explains, and its stability is threatened by human disruption. The assumption that we can continue to use fossil fuels and \"adapt\" to climate disruption, Woodwell argues, is a ticket to catastrophe. </p> <p>But Woodwell points the way toward a solution. We must respect the full range of life on Earth - not species alone, but their natural communities of plant and animal life that have built, and still maintain, the biosphere. We must recognize that the Earth's living systems are our heritage and that the preservation of the integrity of a finite biosphere is a necessity and an inviolable human right. </p>";
