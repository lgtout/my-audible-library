window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This unique and ground-breaking audiobook is the result of 15 years research and synthesises over 800 meta-analyses on the influences on achievement in school-aged students. It builds a story about the power of teachers, feedback, and a model of learning and understanding. The research involves many millions of students and represents the largest-ever evidence-based research into what actually works in schools to improve learning. Areas covered include the influence of the student, home, school, curricula, teacher, and teaching strategies. A model of teaching and learning is developed based on the notion of visible teaching and visible learning.&nbsp;</p> <p>A major message is that what works best for students is similar to what works best for teachers - an attention to setting challenging learning intentions, being clear about what success means, and an attention to learning strategies for developing conceptual understanding about what teachers and students know and understand.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although the current evidence-based fad has turned into a debate about test scores, this audiobook is about using evidence to build and defend a model of teaching and learning. A major contribution is a fascinating benchmark/dashboard for comparing many innovations in teaching and schools.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Visible Learning</i> is expertly narrated by Brian Arens. All visual elements from the text are included in the supplementary PDF. <b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
