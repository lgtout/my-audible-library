Consumption in the global North can’t continue unabated, and we must give up the idea that humans can fully control the Earth through technological “fixes” that only wreak further havoc.</p> <p>Rather than allow the forces of the free market to destroy the planet, we must strive for a post-capitalist society able to guarantee the good life for the entire planet. This plan, which they call half-Earth socialism, means we must:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Rewild half the Earth to absorb carbon emissions and restore biodiversity,</li> <li>Pursue a rapid transition to renewable energy, paired with drastic cuts in consumption by the world’s wealthiest populations,</li> <li>Enact global veganism to cut down on energy and land use,</li> <li>Inaugurate worldwide socialist planning to efficiently and equitably manage production, and</li> <li>Welcome the participation of everyone—even you!</li> </ul> <p>Accompanied by a climate-modeling website inviting listeners to design their own “half Earth,” Vettesse and Pendergrass offer us a visionary way forward—and our only hope for a future.</p>";
