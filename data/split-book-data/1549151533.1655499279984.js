window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A \"marvelous\" (</b><b><i>Economist</i></b><b>) account of how the Christian Revolution forged the Western imagination.</b></p> <p>Crucifixion, the Romans believed, was the worst fate imaginable, a punishment reserved for slaves. How astonishing it was, then, that people should have come to believe that one particular victim of crucifixion - an obscure provincial by the name of Jesus - was to be worshipped as a god. <i>Dominion </i>explores the implications of this shocking conviction as they have reverberated throughout history.&nbsp;</p> <p>Today, the West remains utterly saturated by Christian assumptions. As Tom Holland demonstrates, our morals and ethics are not universal but are instead the fruits of a very distinctive civilization. Concepts such as secularism, liberalism, science, and homosexuality are deeply rooted in a Christian seedbed. From Babylon to the Beatles, Saint Michael to #MeToo, <i>Dominion </i>tells the story of how Christianity transformed the modern world.</p>";
