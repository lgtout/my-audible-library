window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"The saga of GameStop and other meme stocks is revealed with the skill of a thrilling whodunit. Jakab writes with an anti-Midas touch.&nbsp;If he touched gold, he would bring it to life.\" (Burton G. Malkiel, author of </b><b><i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>From </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> columnist Spencer Jakab, the real story of the GameStop squeeze - and the surprising winners of a rigged game.</b></p> <p>During one crazy week in January 2021, a motley crew of retail traders on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets forum had seemingly done the impossible - they had brought some of the biggest, richest players on Wall Street to their knees. Their weapon was GameStop, a failing retailer whose shares briefly became the most traded security on the planet and the subject of intense media coverage.</p> <p><i>The Revolution That Wasn’t </i>is the riveting story of how the meme stock squeeze unfolded, and of the real architects (and winners) of the GameStop rally. Drawing on his years as a stock analyst at a major bank, Jakab exposes technological and financial innovations such as Robinhood’s habit-forming smartphone app as ploys to get our dollars within the larger story of evolving social and economic pressures. The surprising truth? What appeared to be a watershed moment - a revolution that stripped the ultra-powerful hedge funds of their market influence, placing power back in the hands of everyday investors - only tilted the odds further in the house’s favor.</p> <p>Online brokerages love to talk about empowerment and “democratizing finance” while profiting from the mistakes and volatility created by novice investors. In this nuanced analysis, Jakab shines a light on the often misunderstood profit motives and financial mechanisms to show how this so-called revolution is, on balance, a bonanza for Wall Street. But, Jakab argues, there really is a way for ordinary investors to beat the pros: by refusing to play their game.</p>";
