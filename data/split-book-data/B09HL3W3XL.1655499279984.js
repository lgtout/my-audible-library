window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A former firearms executive pulls back the curtain on America's multibillion-dollar gun industry, exposing how it fostered extremism and racism, radicalizing the nation and bringing cultural division to a boiling point.</b></p> <p>As an avid hunter, outdoorsman, and conservationist - all things that the firearms industry was built on - Ryan Busse chased a childhood dream and built a successful career selling millions of firearms&nbsp;for one of America’s most popular gun companies.</p> <p>But blinded by the promise of massive profits,&nbsp;the gun industry abandoned its self-imposed decency&nbsp;in favor of&nbsp;hardline conservatism and&nbsp;McCarthyesque internal policing, sowing irreparable division in our politics and society. That drove Busse to do something few other gun executives have done: He's ending his 30-year career in the industry to show us how and why we got here.</p> <p><i>Gunfight</i>&nbsp;is an insider’s&nbsp;call-out&nbsp;of a wild, secretive, and critically important industry. It shows us how&nbsp;America's gun industry shifted from prioritizing safety and ethics to one that&nbsp;is addicted&nbsp;to fear, conspiracy, intolerance, and secrecy. It recounts Busse's personal transformation and shows&nbsp;how authoritarianism spreads in the guise of freedom, how voicing one's conscience becomes an act of treason in a culture that demands sameness and loyalty.&nbsp;<i>Gunfight</i>&nbsp;offers&nbsp;a&nbsp;valuable&nbsp;perspective&nbsp;as the nation&nbsp;struggles to choose between armed violence or healing.</p>";
