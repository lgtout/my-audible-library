In <i>Firepower</i>, acclaimed historian Paul Lockhart tells the story of the evolution of weaponry&nbsp;and how it&nbsp;transformed&nbsp;not only&nbsp;the conduct of warfare,&nbsp;but also the very structure of power&nbsp;in the West,&nbsp;from the Renaissance to the dawn of the atomic era.&nbsp;</p> <p>Across this period, improvements&nbsp;in&nbsp;firepower&nbsp;shaped&nbsp;the&nbsp;evolving art of war.&nbsp;For&nbsp;centuries, weaponry&nbsp;had&nbsp;remained simple enough that any state could equip a respectable army.&nbsp;That all changed around 1870,&nbsp;when&nbsp;the cost of investing in increasingly complicated technology&nbsp;soon&nbsp;meant&nbsp;that&nbsp;only a handful of great powers could afford to manufacture&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;weaponry,&nbsp;while other countries fell behind. Going beyond the battlefield,&nbsp;<i>Firepower&nbsp;</i>ultimately&nbsp;reveals&nbsp;how&nbsp;changes in&nbsp;weapons technology&nbsp;reshaped&nbsp;human history.</p>";
