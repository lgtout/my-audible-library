window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A hilarious and inspiring memoir about one young woman's journey to find a better path to both physical and mental health.</b> </p> <p>At 29, Kelsey Miller had done it all: crash diets, healthy diets, and nutritionist-prescribed \"eating plans\", which are diets that you pay more money for. She'd been fighting her un-thin body since early childhood and, after a lifetime of failure, finally hit bottom. No diet could transform her body or her life. There was no shortcut to skinny salvation. She'd dug herself into this hole, and now it was time to climb out of it. </p> <p>With the help of an intuitive eating coach and fitness professionals, she learned how to eat based on her body's instincts and exercise sustainably, without obsessing over calories burned and thighs gapped. But with each thrilling step toward a healthy future, she had to contend with the painful truths of her past. </p> <p><i>Big Girl</i> chronicles Kelsey's journey into self-loathing and disordered eating - and out of it. This is a memoir for anyone who's dealt with a distorted body image, food issues, or a dysfunctional family. It's for the late bloomers and the not yet bloomed. It's for everyone who's tried and failed and felt like a big, fat loser. So, basically, everyone. </p>";
