window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Over the last 40 years our choices have narrowed, our opportunities have shrunk, and our lives have become governed by a handful of very large and very powerful corporations. Today, practically everything we buy, everywhere we shop, and every service we secure comes from a heavily concentrated market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This is a world where four major banks control most of our money, four airlines shuttle most of us around the country, and four major cell phone providers connect most of our communications. If you are sick, you can go to one of three main pharmacies to fill your prescription, and if you end up in a hospital almost every accessory to heal you comes from one of a handful of large medical suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Dayen, the editor of the American Prospect and author of the acclaimed <i>Chain of Title</i>, provides a riveting account of what it means to live in this new age of monopoly and how we might resist this corporate hegemony. Through vignettes and vivid case studies, Dayen shows how these monopolies have transformed us, inverted us, and truly changed our lives, at the same time providing listeners with the raw material to make monopoly a consequential issue in American life and revive a long-dormant antitrust movement.</p>";
