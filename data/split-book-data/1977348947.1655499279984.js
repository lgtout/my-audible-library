window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a crucial passage from the Old Testament, God grants mankind power over animals. But with this privilege comes the grave responsibility to respect life, to treat animals with simple dignity and compassion. Somewhere along the way, something has gone wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Dominion</i>, we witness the annual convention of Safari Club International, an organization whose wealthier members will pay up to $20,000 to hunt an elephant, a lion, or another animal, either abroad or in American \"safari ranches\", where the animals are fenced in pens. We attend the annual International Whaling Commission conference, where the skewed politics of the whaling industry come to light, and the focus is on developing more lethal, but not more merciful, methods of harvesting \"living marine resources\". And we visit a gargantuan American \"factory farm\", where animals are treated as mere product and raised in conditions of mass confinement, bred for passivity and bulk, inseminated and fed with machines, and slaughtered in a way that maximizes profits and minimizes decency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The result is eye-opening, painful and infuriating, insightful and rewarding. <i>Dominion</i> is a plea for human benevolence and mercy, a scathing attack on those who would dismiss animal activists as mere sentimentalists, and a demand for reform from the government down to the individual.</p>";
