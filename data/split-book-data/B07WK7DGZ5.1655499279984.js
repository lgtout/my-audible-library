window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why do terrorist organizations use children to support their cause and carry out their activities? <i>Small Arms</i> uncovers the brutal truth behind the mobilization of children by terrorist groups.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mia Bloom and John Horgan show us the grim underbelly of society that allows and even encourages the use of children to conduct terrorist activities. They provide listeners with the who, what, when, why, and how of this increasingly concerning situation, illuminating a phenomenon that to most of us seems abhorrent. And yet, they argue, for terrorist groups the use of children carries many benefits. Children possess skills that adults lack. They often bring innovation and creativity. Children are, in fact, a superb demographic from which to recruit if you are a terrorist.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Small Arms</i> answers questions about recruitment strategies and tactics, determines what makes a child terrorist and what makes him or her different from an adult one, and charts the ways in which organizations use them. The unconventional focus on child and youth militants allows the authors to, in essence, give us a biography of the child terrorist and the organizations that use them. We are taken inside the mind of the adult and the child to witness that which perhaps most scares us.&nbsp;</p> <p>The book is published by Cornell University Press.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"A timely book on a critical and long-neglected subject…sheds new light on this odious and, sadly, increasingly prevalent phenomenon.\" (Bruce Hoffman, Georgetown University)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Highly recommended for anyone interested in how terrorism and terrorists evolve.\" (Jessica Stern, Boston University)</p>";
