window.bookSummaryJSON = "The best-selling author of <i>The Botany of Desire</i> explores the ecology of eating to unveil why we consume what we consume in the 21st century. <p>\"What should we have for dinner?\" To one degree or another, this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn't, which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance.</p> <p>The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i> is best-selling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America.</p> <p>We are indeed what we eat, and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i> is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as \"What shall we have for dinner?\"</p>";
