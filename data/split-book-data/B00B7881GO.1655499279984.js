window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Like many people, Beth Terry didn't think an individual could have much impact on the environment. But while laid up after surgery, she read an article about the staggering amount of plastic polluting the oceans and decided then and there to kick her plastic habit. Now she wants to teach you how you can too. In her quirky and humorous style - well known to the fans of her popular blog, My Plastic-Free Life - Terry provides personal anecdotes, stats about the environmental and health problems related to plastic, and personal solutions and tips on how to limit your plastic footprint. Terry includes handy lists and charts for easy reference, ways to get involved in larger community actions, and profiles of individuals - Plastic-Free Heroes - who have gone beyond personal solutions to create a change on a larger scale. <i>Plastic-Free</i> also includes chapters on letting go of eco-guilt, strategies for coping with overwhelming problems, and ways to relate to other people who aren't as far along on the plastic-free path. </p><p> Both a practical guide and the story of a personal journey from helplessness to empowerment, <i>Plastic-Free</i> is a must-listen for anyone concerned about the ongoing health and happiness of themselves, their children, and the planet. </p>";
