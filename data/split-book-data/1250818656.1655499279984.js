window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>From the host of NPR’s </b><b><i>Planet Money</i></b><b>, the deeply investigated story of how one visionary, ruthless investor changed American finance forever.</b></p> <p>Before Bill Gross was known among investors as the Bond King, he was a gambler. In 1966, a fresh college grad, he went to Vegas armed with his net worth ($200) and a knack for counting cards. Ten thousand dollars and countless casino bans later, he was hooked, so he enrolled in business school.</p> <p><i>The Bond King</i> is the story of how that whiz kid made American finance his casino. Over the course of decades, Bill Gross turned the sleepy bond market into a destabilized game of high risk, high reward; founded Pimco, one of today’s most powerful, secretive, and cutthroat investment firms; helped to reshape our financial system in the aftermath of the Great Recession - to his own advantage; and gained legions of admirers, and enemies, along the way. Like every American antihero, his ambition would also be his undoing.</p> <p>To understand the winners and losers of today’s money game, journalist Mary Childs argues, is to understand the bond market - and to understand the bond market is to understand the Bond King.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books</b></p>";
