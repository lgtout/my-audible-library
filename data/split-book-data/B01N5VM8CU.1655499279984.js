window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What happens when a society is run by people who are antisocial? Welcome to baby boomer America. </p> <p>In <i>A Generation of Sociopaths</i>, Bruce Cannon Gibney shows how America was hijacked by the boomers, a generation whose reckless self-indulgence degraded the foundations of American prosperity. A former partner in a leading venture capital firm, Gibney examines the disastrous policies of the most powerful generation in modern history, showing how the boomers ruthlessly enriched themselves at the expense of future generations. </p> <p>Acting without empathy, prudence, or respect for facts - acting, in other words, as sociopaths - the boomers turned American dynamism into stagnation, inequality, and bipartisan fiasco. The boomers have set a time bomb for the 2030s, when damage to Social Security, public finances, and the environment will become catastrophic and possibly irreversible - and when, not coincidentally, boomers will be dying off. </p> <p>Gibney, whose 2011 essay \"What Happened to the Future?\" transfixed the investment world, argues that younger generations have a fleeting window to hold the boomers accountable and begin restoring America. Distilling deep research into a witty, colorful indictment of the boomers and an urgent defense of the once-unquestioned value of society, <i>A Generation of Sociopaths</i> is poised to become one of the most controversial books of the year. </p>";
