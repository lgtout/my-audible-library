window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Life on one-tenth the fossil fuels can be awesome. </b></p> <p>We all want to be happy. Yet as we consume ever more in a frantic bid for happiness, global warming worsens.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alarmed by drastic changes now occurring in the Earth's climate systems, the author, a climate scientist and suburban father of two, embarked on a journey to change his life and the world. He began by bicycling, growing food, meditating, and making other simple, fulfilling changes. Ultimately, he slashed his climate impact to under a tenth of the US average and became happier in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Being the Change </i>explores the connections between our individual daily actions and our collective predicament. It merges science, spirituality, and practical action to develop a satisfying and appropriate response to global warming.&nbsp;</p> <p>Part one exposes our interconnected predicament: overpopulation, global warming, industrial agriculture, growth-addicted economics, a sold-out political system, and a mindset of separation from nature. It also includes a readable but authoritative overview of climate science. Part two offers a response at once obvious and unprecedented: mindfully opting out of this broken system and aligning our daily lives with the biosphere.&nbsp;</p> <p>The core message is deeply optimistic: Living without fossil fuels is not only possible, it can be better.&nbsp;</p> <p>Peter Kalmus is an atmospheric scientist at Caltech/Jet Propulsion Laboratory with a PhD in physics from Columbia University. He lives in suburban Altadena, California, with his wife and two children on one-tenth the fossil fuels of the average American. Peter speaks purely on his own behalf, not on behalf of NASA or Jet Propulsion Laboratory.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note: When you purchase this title,&nbsp;the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. </b></p>";
