window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine a product that increases alertness, boosts creativity, reduces stress, improves perception, stamina, motor skills, and accuracy, enhances your sex life, helps you make better decisions, keeps you looking younger, aids in weight loss, reduces the risk of heart attack, elevates your mood, and strengthens memory. Now imagine that this product is nontoxic, has no dangerous side effects, and, best of all, is absolutely free.</p> <p>This miracle drug is, in fact, nothing more than the nap: the right nap at the right time. The work of Sara C. Mednick, PhD, a researcher at the Salk Institute and the leading authority on the study of the nap, <i>Take a Nap! Change Your Life.</i> is the scientifically based breakthrough program that shows how we can fight the fatigue epidemic - which afflicts an estimated 50 million Americans - through a custom-designed nap.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Take a Nap! Change Your Life. </i>explains the five stages of the sleep cycle, particularly stage two, slow wave sleep, and REM, and the benefits each one provides; how to assess your tiredness and set up a personal sleep profile; and how to neutralize the voice in your head that tells you napping is a sign of laziness. (Not that anyone would have called JFK, Churchill, Einstein, or Napoleon a slug-a-bed.)&nbsp;</p> <p>It shows us how to determine exactly when our optimum napping time is and exactly how long we should try to sleep - even how it’s possible to design a nap to inspire creativity one day and the next day design one to help us with our memory. There are tips on how to create the right nap environment, a 16-step technique for falling asleep, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This audiobook edition includes a downloadble PDF containing a Glossary of Terms, as well as charts from the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
