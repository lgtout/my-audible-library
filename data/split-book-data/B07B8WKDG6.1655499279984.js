window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The dark story of the shocking resurgence of white supremacist and nationalist groups, and their path to political power </b></p> <p>Six years ago, Vegas Tenold embedded himself among the members of three of America's most ideologically extreme white nationalist groups - the KKK, the National Socialist Movement, and the Traditionalist Workers Party.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the time, these groups were part of a disorganized counterculture that felt far from the mainstream. But since then, all that has changed. Racially motivated violence has been on open display at rallies in Charlottesville, Berkeley, Pikesville, Phoenix, and Boston. Membership in white nationalist organizations is rising, and national politicians, including the president, are validating their perceived grievances. <i>Everything You Love Will Burn </i>offers a terrifying, sobering inside look at these newly empowered movements, from their conventions to backroom meetings with Republican operatives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tenold introduces us to neo-Nazis in Brooklyn; a millennial Klanswoman in Tennessee; and a rising star in the movement, nicknamed the \"Little FÃ¿ by the Southern Poverty Law Center, who understands political power and is organizing a grand coalition of far-right groups to bring them into the mainstream.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Everything You Love Will Burn</i> takes listeners to the dark, paranoid underbelly of America, a world in which the white race is under threat and the enemy is everywhere.&nbsp;</p>";
