window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From “one of the most emotionally exacting, mercilessly candid, deeply funny, and intellectually rigorous writers of our time” (Cheryl Strayed, author of </b><b><i>Wild</i></b><b>) comes a seminal new audiobook that reaches surprising truths about feminism, the Trump era, and the Resistance movement. You won’t be able to stop thinking and talking about it. </b></p> <p>In the fall of 2016, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Meghan Daum began working on a book about the excesses of contemporary feminism. With Hilary Clinton soon to be elected, she figured even the most fiercely liberal of her friends and readers could take the criticisms in stride. But after the election, she knew she needed to do more, and her nearly completed manuscript went in the trash. What came out in its place is the most sharply observed and all-encompassing work of her career.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this gripping new work, Meghan examines our country’s most intractable problems with clear-eyed honesty instead of exaggerated outrage. With passion, humor, and most importantly, nuance, she tries to make sense of the current landscape - from Donald Trump’s presidency to the #MeToo movement and beyond. In the process, she wades into the waters of identity politics and intersectionality, thinks deeply about the gender wage gap, and tests a theory about the divide between Gen Xers and millennials.</p> <p>This signature work may well be the first to capture the essence of this era in all its nuances and contradictions. No matter where you stand on its issues, this audiobook will strike a chord.</p>";
