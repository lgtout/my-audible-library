window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A maddened creature, frothing at the mouth, lunges at an innocent victim—and with a bite, transforms its prey into another raving monster. It’s a scenario that underlies our darkest tales of supernatural horror, but its power derives from a very real virus, a deadly scourge known to mankind from our earliest days. In this fascinating exploration, journalist Bill Wasik and veterinarian Monica Murphy chart four thousand years in the history, science, and cultural mythology of rabies. </p> <p>The most fatal virus known to science, rabies kills nearly 100 percent of its victims once the infection takes root in the brain. A disease that spreads avidly from animals to humans, rabies has served as a symbol of savage madness and inhuman possession throughout history. Today, its history can help shed light on the wave of emerging diseases—from AIDS to SARS to avian flu—with origins in animal populations. </p> <p>From Greek myths to zombie flicks, from the laboratory heroics of Louis Pasteur to the contemporary search for a lifesaving treatment, <i>Rabid</i> is a fresh, fascinating, and often wildly entertaining look at one of mankind’s oldest and most fearsome foes. </p> <p>Bill Wasik is a senior editor at <i>Wired</i> magazine and was previously a senior editor at <i>Harper’s,</i> where he wrote on culture, media, and politics. He is the editor of the anthology <i>Submersion Journalism</i> and has also written for <i>Oxford American, Slate, Salon,</i> and <i>McSweeney’s.</i></p>";
