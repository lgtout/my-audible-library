window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A comprehensive and accessible exploration of anxiety from a leading neuroscientist and the author of <i>Synaptic Self</i>. </p> <p>Collectively, anxiety disorders are our most prevalent psychiatric problem, affecting about 40 million adults in the United States. In <i>Anxious</i>, Joseph LeDoux, whose NYU lab has been at the forefront of research efforts to understand and treat fear and anxiety, explains the range of these disorders, their origins, and discoveries that can restore sufferers to normalcy. LeDoux's groundbreaking premise is that we've been thinking about fear and anxiety in the wrong way. These are not innate states waiting to be unleashed from the brain but experiences that we assemble cognitively. Treatment of these problems must address both their conscious manifestations and underlying nonconscious processes. While knowledge about how the brain works will help us discover new drugs, LeDoux argues that the greatest breakthroughs may come from using brain research to help reshape psychotherapy. A major work on our most pressing mental health issue, <i>Anxious</i> explains the science behind fear and anxiety disorders. </p>";
