With&nbsp;Kilo, cocaine now has its own&nbsp;Dispatches. Simply kickass.” (Jon Lee Anderson,&nbsp;The New Yorker&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<i>Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life</i>)</p> <p>Cocaine is glamour, sex, and murder. From the badlands of Colombia, it stretches across the globe, seducing, corrupting, and destroying. A product that must be produced, distributed, and protected, it is both a harbinger of violence and a source of immense wealth. Beginning in the jungles and mountains of Colombia, it filters down to countryside villages and the nightclubs of the cities, attracting money, sex, and death. Each step in the life of a kilo reveals a different criminal underworld with its own players, rules, and dangers, ranging from the bizarre to the diabolical. The killers, the drug-lords, all find themselves seduced by cocaine and trapped in her world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Seasoned war correspondent Toby Muse has witnessed each level of this underworld, fueled by the appetite for cocaine in America and Europe. In this riveting chronicle, he takes the listener inside Colombia’s notorious drug cartels to offer a groundbreaking look at the drug trade. Following a kilo of cocaine from its production in a clandestine laboratory to the smugglers who ship it abroad, he reveals the human lives behind the drug’s complicated legacy. Reporting on Colombia for the world’s most prestigious networks and publications, Muse gained unprecedented access to the extraordinary people who survive on the drug trade - farmers, smugglers, assassins - and the drug lords and their lovers controlling these multi-billion dollar enterprises. Uncovering stories of violence, sex, and money, he shows the allure and the madness of cocaine. And how the War on Drugs has been no match for cocaine.&nbsp;</p> <p>Piercing this veiled world,&nbsp;<i>Kilo&nbsp;</i>is a gripping portrait of a country struggling to end this deadly trade even as the riches flow. A human portrait of criminals and the shocking details of their lives,&nbsp;<i>Kilo&nbsp;</i>is a chilling, unforgettable story that takes you deep into the belly of the beast.</p>";
