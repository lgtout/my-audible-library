window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>One Breath at a Time: Buddhism and the Twelve Steps</i> has established itself as a classic, a bellwether of the most significant recovery movement of the 21st century, combining Buddhist mindfulness practices with a 12-step recovery program. </p> <p>Published in 2004, <i>One Breath at a Time</i> has never lost its place as the best-selling Buddhist recovery book. We are proud to present an audio edition of this transformative work. </p> <p>What gives the book its enduring value is Griffin's intimate and revealing tales of his own and other's addiction and recovery, combined with his unique capacity to translate traditional 12-step concepts like powerlessness, higher power, and character defects into meaningful contemporary terms. He explores all this through the lens of the core concepts of Buddhism: the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, mindfulness, loving-kindness, and more. The result is a book that has transformed the lives of thousands of addicts and alcoholics. </p> <p>Narrated by Kevin himself, the audio version brings this classic book to life. </p>";
