window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Thing 1:</b> There is no such thing as the free market.<br><b>Thing 4:</b> The washing machine has changed the world more than the Internet.<br><b>Thing 5:</b> Assume the worst about people, and you get the worst.<br><b>Thing 13:</b> Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer. </p> <p>If you've wondered how we did not see the economic collapse coming, Ha-Joon Chang knows the answer: We didn't ask what they didn't tell us about capitalism. This is a lighthearted book with a serious purpose: to question the assumptions behind the dogma and sheer hype that the dominant school of neoliberal economists - the apostles of the freemarket - have spun since the Age of Reagan. </p> <p>Chang, the author of the international best seller <i>Bad Samaritans</i>, is one of the world's most respected economists, a voice of sanity - and wit - in the tradition of John Kenneth Galbraith and Joseph Stiglitz. </p> <p><i>23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism</i> equips listeners with an understanding of how global capitalism works - and doesn't. In his final chapter, \"How to Rebuild the World\", Chang offers a vision of how we can shape capitalism to humane ends, instead of becoming slaves of the market. </p> <p>Ha-Joon Chang teaches in the Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge. His books include the best-selling <i>Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism</i>. His <i>Kicking Away the Ladder</i> received the 2003 Myrdal Prize, and, in 2005, Chang was awarded the Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought.</p>";
