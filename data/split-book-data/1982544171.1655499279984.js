window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This landmark book from an expert in dignity studies explores the essential but under-recognized role of dignity as part of good leadership. Extending the reach of her award-winning book <i>Dignity: Its Essential Role in Resolving Conflict</i>, Donna Hicks now contributes a specific, practical guide to achieving a culture of dignity.</p> <p>Most people know very little about dignity, the author has found, and when leaders fail to respect the dignity of others, conflict and distrust ensue. She highlights three components of leading with dignity: what one must<i> know</i> in order to honor dignity and avoid violating it; what one must<i> do</i> to lead with dignity; and how one can <i>create</i> a culture of dignity in any organization, whether corporate, religious, governmental, health care, or beyond. Brimming with key research findings, real-life case studies, and workable recommendations, this book fills an important gap in our understanding of how best to be together in a conflict-ridden world.</p>";
