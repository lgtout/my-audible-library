window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this provocative new book, psychologist and social commentator Dr. Jean Twenge documents the self-focus of what she calls \"Generation Me\" - people born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Dr. Twenge explores why her generation is tolerant, confident, open-minded, and ambitious but also cynical, depressed, lonely, and anxious. Dr. Twenge reveals how profoundly different today's young adults are - and makes controversial predictions about what the future holds for them and society as a whole. </p> <p>But Dr. Twenge doesn't just talk statistics - she highlights real-life people and stories. With a good deal of irony, humor, and sympathy, she demonstrates that today's young people have been raised to aim for the stars at a time when it is more difficult than ever to get into college, find a good job, and afford a house. Dr. Twenge also presents the often-shocking truths about her generation's dramatically different sexual behavior and mores. </p> <p>Engaging, controversial, prescriptive, and often funny, <i>Generation Me</i> will give boomers new insight into their offspring and help GenMe'ers in their teens, 20s, and 30s finally make sense of themselves and their goals and find their road to happiness. </p>";
