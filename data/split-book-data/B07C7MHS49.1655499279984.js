window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why is it so hard for us to connect on a deep level with others, particularly those who are suffering? We constantly find ourselves interrupted and inundated with tasks and stresses. We are disconnected, sleepwalking through our lives, unable to help even ourselves.</p> <p>There is a better way. Dr. David Rakel draws on his clinical experience with patients and the latest research from medicine, psychology, and neuroscience to describe the power of human connection and the ways it can be used to boost health and well-being. Once we understand this power and learn the tools that are necessary to create a connection, we can live with clarity, creativity, wisdom, and good health. <i>The Compassionate Connection</i> will give us the skills to improve the quality of our relationships, whether doctor/patient, husband/wife, parent/child, teacher/student, or boss/employee.</p>";
