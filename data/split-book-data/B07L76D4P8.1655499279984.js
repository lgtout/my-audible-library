window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“For too long the struggle for the rights of women and girls was seen as women’s business. Of course, it’s equally men’s business and stops being such a struggle when it’s seen that way. This reframing gives us a chance to understand violence against women as deeply toxic for us all.” -Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN Women</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Time Has Come</i> explores how a patriarchal culture that has given power to men comes at a huge cost to women, children, and, surprisingly, to men as well. It details how very achievable changes in our workplaces, in the ways we raise boys to be men, and in the movement to end men’s violence will bring significant rewards to communities all around the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Michael Kaufman is the cofounder of the White Ribbon Campaign - the largest international network of men working to end violence against women - and for decades has been an advisor on gender equality to the United Nations, governments, NGOs, schools, and workplaces around the world. With honest storytelling, compassion, and hard-hitting analysis, <i>The Time Has Come</i> is a compelling look at why men must take a stand in the fight for general equality.</p>";
