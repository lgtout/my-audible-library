That if we want to overachieve, we have to overexert, overthink, and overdo. That if we aren’t perpetually exhausted, we’re not doing enough.&nbsp;</p> <p>But lately, working hard is more exhausting than ever. And the more depleted we get, the more effort it takes to make progress.&nbsp;Stuck in an endless loop of “Zoom, eat, sleep, repeat”,&nbsp;we’re often working twice as hard to achieve half as much.&nbsp;</p> <p>Getting ahead doesn’t have to be as hard as we make it. No matter what challenges or obstacles we face, there is a better way: Instead of pushing ourselves harder,&nbsp;we can find an easier path.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Effortless</i>&nbsp;offers actionable advice for&nbsp;making the most essential activities the easiest ones,&nbsp;so you can achieve the results you want, without burning out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Effortless&nbsp;</i>teaches you how to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Turn tedious tasks into enjoyable rituals&nbsp;</li> <li>Prevent frustration by solving problems before they arise&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Set a sustainable pace instead of powering through&nbsp;</li> <li>Make one-time choices that eliminate many future decisions&nbsp;</li> <li>Simplify your processes by removing unnecessary steps</li> <li>Make relationships easier to maintain and manage</li> <li>And much more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>The effortless way isn't the lazy way. It's the smart way. It may even be the only way.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not every hard thing in life can be made easy. But we can make it easier to do more of what matters most.</p>";
