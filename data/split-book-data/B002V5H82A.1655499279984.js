window.bookSummaryJSON = "The #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author provides a shocking analysis of the crisis in Pakistan and the renewed radicalism threatening Afghanistan and the West. <p>Ahmed Rashid is \"Pakistan's best and bravest reporter\" (Christopher Hitchens). His unique knowledge of this vast and complex region allows him a panoramic vision and nuance that no Western writer can emulate.</p> <p>His book <i>Taliban</i> introduced American readers to the brutal regime that hijacked Afghanistan and harbored the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Now, Rashid examines Central Asia, and the corridors of power in Washington and Europe, to see how the promised nation building in the region has progressed.</p> <p>His conclusions are devastating: an unstable and nuclear-armed Pakistan, a renewed al Qaeda profiting from a booming opium trade, and a Taliban resurgence and reconquest.</p> <p>While Iraq continues to attract most of the American media and military might, Rashid argues that Pakistan and Afghanistan are where the conflict will finally be played out and that these failing states pose a graver threat to global security than does the Middle East.</p> <p>Benazir Bhutto's assassination and the crisis on Pakistan are only the beginning. Rashid assesses what her death means for the region and the future. Rashid has unparalleled access to the figures in this global drama and provides up-to- the-minute analysis better than anyone else. <i>Descent into Chaos</i> will do for Central Asia what Thomas Ricks' <i>Fiasco</i> did for Iraq - offer a blistering critique of recent American policy and an impassioned call to correct our failed strategy in the region.</p>";
