window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An audiobook for learners of all ages containing the best and most updated advice on learning from neuroscience and cognitive psychology.</b></p> <p>Do you spend too much time learning with disappointing results? Do you find it difficult to remember what you read? Do you put off studying because it’s boring and you’re easily distracted? This book is for you.</p> <p>Dr. Barbara Oakley and Olav Schewe have both struggled in the past with their learning. But they have found techniques to help them master any material. Building on insights from neuroscience and cognitive psychology, they give you a crash course to improve your ability to learn, no matter what the subject is. Through their decades of writing, teaching, and research on learning, the authors have developed deep connections with experts from a vast array of disciplines. And it’s all honed with feedback from thousands of students who have themselves gone through the trenches of learning. Successful learners gradually add tools and techniques to their mental toolbox, and they think critically about their learning to determine when and how to best use their mental tools. That allows these learners to make the best use of their brains, whether those brains seem “naturally” geared toward learning or not. This book will teach you how you can do the same.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Essentials</b></p> <p>\"<i>Learn Like a Pro</i> is the book I wish I’d had when I was a student. It is jam-packed with practical, evidence-based advice for overcoming procrastination, strengthening memory, and reading more effectively. You’ll find a nugget of learning gold on every page.\" (Daniel H. Pink, number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>When</i>, <i>Drive</i>, and <i>To Sell Is Human</i>)</p> <p>\"If you want to learn how to learn, I can’t think of better guides than Barbara Oakley and Olav Schewe. They transformed themselves from struggling students into master teachers, and they’ve written an unusually digestible, immediately useful book about how to build your knowledge, improve your memory, and boost your motivation to keep getting smarter.\" (Adam Grant, number one <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Think Again</i> and host of the TED podcast WorkLife)</p>";
