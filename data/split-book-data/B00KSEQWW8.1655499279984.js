window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Narcissism - an inflated view of the self - is everywhere. Public figures say it's what makes them stray from their wives. Parents teach it by dressing children in T-shirts that say \"Princess\". Teenagers and young adults hone it on Facebook, and celebrity newsmakers have elevated it to an art form. And it's what's making people depressed, lonely, and buried under piles of debt. Dr. Jean M. Twenge focuses on the pernicious spread of narcissism in today's culture, which has repercussions for every age group and class. Dr. Twenge joins forces with Dr. W. Keith Campbell, a nationally recognized expert on narcissism, to explore this new plague. Together, they provide an eye-opening exposition of the alarming rise of narcissism and its catastrophic effects at every level of society.</p>";
