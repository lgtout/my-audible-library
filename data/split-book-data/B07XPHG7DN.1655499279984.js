window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A generation-defining examination of the new midlife crisis facing Gen X women and the unique circumstances that have brought them to this point, <i>Why We Can’t Sleep</i> is a lively successor to <i>Passages</i> by Gail Sheehy and <i>The Defining Decade</i> by Meg Jay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>When Ada Calhoun found herself in the throes of a midlife crisis, she thought that she had no right to complain. She was married with children and a good career. So why did she feel miserable? And why did it seem that other Generation X women were miserable, too?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Calhoun decided to find some answers. She looked into housing costs, HR trends, credit card debt averages, and divorce data. At every turn, she saw a pattern: sandwiched between the Boomers and Millennials, Gen X women were facing new problems as they entered middle age, problems that were being largely overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Speaking with women across America about their experiences as the generation expected to “have it all”, Calhoun found that most were exhausted, terrified about money, under-employed, and overwhelmed. Instead of their issues being heard, they were told to lean in, take “me time”, or make a chore chart to get their lives and homes in order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Why We Can’t Sleep</i>, Calhoun opens up the cultural and political contexts of Gen X’s predicament and offers solutions for how to pull oneself out of the abyss - and keep the next generation from falling in. The result is reassuring, empowering, and essential listening for all middle-aged women, and anyone who hopes to understand them.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
