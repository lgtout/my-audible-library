Why are LGBTQ+ people stereotyped as being sexually indiscriminate and deceptive?&nbsp;Why are&nbsp;people of color&nbsp;still being&nbsp;hypersexualized?&nbsp;These stereotypes&nbsp;push&nbsp;minorities farther into the margins, and even the privileged&nbsp;are policed from transgressing, lest they also become targets.&nbsp;Many&nbsp;view sexualization as a mere component of&nbsp;sexism,&nbsp;racism,&nbsp;or&nbsp;queerphobia,&nbsp;but Serano argues that&nbsp;liberation&nbsp;from sexual violence comes through&nbsp;collectively confronting&nbsp;sexualization itself.&nbsp;</p>";
