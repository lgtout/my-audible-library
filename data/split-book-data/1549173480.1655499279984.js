window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Storm Before the Storm</i></b><b> and host of the </b><b><i>Revolutions</i></b><b> podcast comes the thrilling story of the Marquis de Lafayetteâ€™s lifelong quest to defend the principles of liberty and equality.</b></p> <p>Few in history can match the revolutionary career of the Marquis de Lafayette. Over 50 incredible years at the heart of the Age of Revolution, he fought courageously on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a soldier, statesman, idealist, philanthropist, and abolitionist.</p> <p>As a teenager, Lafayette ran away from France to join the American Revolution. Returning home a national hero, he helped launch the French Revolution, eventually spending five years locked in dungeon prisons. After his release, Lafayette sparred with Napoleon, joined an underground conspiracy to overthrow King Louis XVIII, and became an international symbol of liberty. Finally, as a revered elder statesman, he was instrumental in the overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty in the Revolution of 1830.</p> <p>From enthusiastic youth to world-weary old age, from the pinnacle of glory to the depths of despair, Lafayette never stopped fighting for the rights of all mankind. His remarkable life is the story of where we come from and an inspiration to defend the ideals he held dear.&nbsp;</p>";
