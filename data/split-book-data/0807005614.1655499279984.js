window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Find hope even in these dark times with this rediscovered masterpiece, a companion to his international best seller </b><b><i>Man's Search for Meaning</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Eleven months after he was liberated from the Nazi concentration camps, Viktor E. Frankl held a series of public lectures in Vienna. The psychiatrist, who would soon become world famous, explained his central thoughts on meaning, resilience, and the importance of embracing life even in the face of great adversity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Published here for the very first time in English, Frankl's words resonate as strongly today - as the world faces a coronavirus pandemic, social isolation, and great economic uncertainty - as they did in 1946. He offers an insightful exploration of the maxim \"Live as if you were living for the second time\", and he unfolds his basic conviction that every crisis contains opportunity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite the unspeakable horrors of the camps, Frankl learned from the strength of his fellow inmates that it is always possible to \"Say yes to life\" - a profound and timeless lesson for us all.&nbsp;</p>";
