window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What happens to us when we die? Are heaven and hell real? If so, what are they like? <i>Heaven and Hell</i> contains the answers to these questions as seen by Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772). </p> <p>This new translation of Swedenborg's most popular work paints a detailed picture of life in the spiritual realms. A Swedish Enlightenment scientist of extraordinary accomplishment, Swedenborg underwent a spiritual crisis that led to an unparalleled series of paranormal experiences. He spent his last 27 years in almost daily experience of heaven and hell, recording his observations and conversations, many of which are reported in <i>Heaven and Hell</i>. This sustained and detailed description of the nonphysical realms has left its impression on the minds of many great thinkers, including Goethe, Blake, Coleridge, Emerson, Borges, and Milosz. </p> <p>The New Century Edition of the works of Emanuel Swedenborg is a modern-language, scholarly translation of Swedenborg's theological works. The series' easy style retains the dignity, variety, clarity, and gender-inclusive language of Swedenborg's original Latin, bringing his thought to life. </p> <p>This portable edition contains the text of the translation, but not the introduction, annotations, or other supplemental materials found the deluxe edition. </p>";
