window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For the first time in history, the world shut itself down - by choice - all for fear of a virus, COVID-19, that wasn’t well understood. The government, with the support of most Americans, ordered the closure of tens of thousands of small businesses - many never to return. Almost every school and college in the country sent its students home to finish the school year in front of a computer. Churches canceled worship services.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Social distancing” went from a non-word to a moral obligation overnight. Moral preening on social media achieved ever new heights. The world will reopen and life will go on,&nbsp;but what kind of world will it be when it does? It can’t be what it was, because of what’s just happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>Professors Jay Richards,&nbsp;William Briggs, and&nbsp;Douglas Axe&nbsp;take a deep dive into the crucial questions on the minds of millions of Americans during one of the most jarring and unprecedented global events in a generation.&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>What will be the total cost in dollars, lives, and livelihoods of this response from governments, on advice from science?&nbsp;</li> <li>What role have national and global health organizations such as WHO played in this? To whom are they accountable?&nbsp;</li> <li>What evidence do they rely on in sounding the alarm?&nbsp;</li> <li>How did science bureaucrats, relying on murky data and speculative computer models, gain the power to shut down the global economy?&nbsp;</li> <li>How did politicians, who know nothing of the science, decide whom to trust?</li> </ul> <p>We need to know what and how it happened to keep it from ever happening again.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
