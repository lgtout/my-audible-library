window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Have you tried every diet or weight loss plan under the sun, but still can't manage to lose weight and keep it off? You aren't alone. Each year, Americans spend billions of dollars on weight-loss products, yet we continue to have the highest obesity rate in the world. After trying and failing countless times, you have to begin to wonder, \"What am I doing wrong?\" </p> <p>The problem with most fad diets is that they only attack the symptom of the problem, not the cause. No matter how much you try to deny yourself the food you crave, you always end up reverting back to bad habits. You might even lose weight initially, but more often than not you'll gain it back - with a couple extra pounds to boot! In order to make real change in your life, you need to change the way you think about food, weight, and what's most important to you. </p> <p><i>The Diet Trap</i> offers proven-effective methods based in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to help you develop mindful eating habits, self-compassion, and a greater understanding of what it means to live a valued life. ACT is a values-based therapy that has been proven effective for the treatment of weight loss. Because ACT encourages you to accept and experience uncomfortable emotions-rather than succumb to emotional eating - it helps you to stay on your path to lose weight, while also helping you develop compassion toward yourself, no matter how much you weigh. </p> <p>Written by two researchers in the field of ACT, this book offers evidence-based solutions to help you fundamentally change the way you think about food, so that you can successfully lose weight, get healthy, and live a happy, fulfilling life without costly and frustrating fad diets. </p>";
