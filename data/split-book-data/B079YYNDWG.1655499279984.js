window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>How to Be Yourself</i></b><b> is the best audiobook you'll ever listen to about how to conquer social anxiety. </b></p> <p><b>\"...a groundbreaking road map to finally being your true, authentic self.\" - Susan Cain, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Quiet</i></b></p> <p>Up to 40% of people consider themselves shy. You might say you're introverted or awkward, or that you're fine around friends but just can't speak up in a meeting or at a party. Maybe you're usually confident but have recently moved or started a new job, only to feel isolated and unsure.</p> <p>If you get nervous in social situations - meeting your partner's friends, public speaking, standing awkwardly in the elevator with your boss - you've probably been told, \"Just be yourself!\" But that's easier said than done - especially if you're prone to social anxiety.</p> <p>Weaving together cutting-edge science, concrete tips, and the compelling stories of real people who have risen above their social anxiety, Dr. Ellen Hendriksen proposes a groundbreaking idea: you already have everything you need to succeed in any unfamiliar social situation. As someone who lives with social anxiety, Dr. Hendriksen has devoted her career to helping her clients overcome the same obstacles she has.</p> <p>With familiarity, humor, and authority, Dr. Hendriksen takes the listener through the roots of social anxiety and why it endures, how we can rewire our brains through our behavior, and - at long last - exactly how to quiet your Inner Critic, the pesky voice that whispers, \"Everyone will judge you.\" Using her techniques to develop confidence, think through the buzz of anxiety, and feel comfortable in any situation, you can finally be your true, authentic self.</p>";
