We all - including people who seem protected by their privileged lives - can experience the self-destructive behaviors common to modern life, including chronic stress, addiction, anxiety, imposter syndrome, infidelity, negative body image, and narcissism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Division marks our era. There's a growing separation between the haves and have nots, men and women, as well as the empowered and the disenfranchised. At the same time, our culture is defined by celebrities, and the powerful, affluent people we put on a pedestal to idolize and emulate. Too often, we think our lives would be better if we could have what they have or be more like them. It's time to realize that even the most admired people can go through life feeling unloved and unable to escape their problems.</p>";
