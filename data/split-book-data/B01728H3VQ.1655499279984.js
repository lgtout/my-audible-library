window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Between his work on the 2014 Audible Audiobook of the Year, <i>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark: A Novel</i>, and his performance of <i>Classic Love Poems</i>, narrator Richard Armitage (<i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>Hannibal</i>) has quickly become a listener favorite. Now, in this defining performance of Charles Dickens' classic <i>David Copperfield</i>, Armitage lends his unique voice and interpretation, truly inhabiting each character and bringing real energy to the life of one of Dickens' most famous characters. </p> <p>This epic, exuberant novel is one of the greatest coming-of-age stories in literature, chronicling David Copperfield's extraordinary journey through life as he encounters villains, saviors, eccentrics, and grotesques - including the wicked Mr. Murdstone, stouthearted Peggotty, formidable Betsey Trotwood, impecunious Micawber, and the odious Uriah Heep. Dickens' great novel (based, in part, on his own boyhood and which he described as a \"favorite child\") is a work filled with life, both comic and tragic. </p> <p>Listen to Richard Armitage bring Dickens' words to life, and you'll understand why Virginia Woolf called <i>David Copperfield</i> \"the most perfect of all the Dickens novels\". </p>";
