It is pollution in the public square, where a smog of adversarial rhetoric, propaganda, and polarization stifles discussion and debate, creating resistance to change and thwarting our ability to solve our collective problems.</p> <p>In <i>I'm Right and You're an Idiot</i>, author and David Suzuki Foundation chair James Hoggan grapples with this critical issue, conducting interviews with outstanding thinkers from the Himalayas to the House of Lords.&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing on the wisdom of such notables as Thich Nhat Hanh, Noam Chomsky, and the Dalai Lama, his comprehensive analysis explores:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>How trust is undermined and misinformation thrives in today's public dialogue</li> <li>Why facts alone fail - the manipulation of language and the silencing of dissent</li> <li>What is the importance of reframing our arguments with empathy and values to create compelling narratives and spur action</li> </ul> <p>Our species' greatest survival strategy has always been foresight and the ability to leverage our intelligence to overcome adversity. For too long now, this capacity has been threatened by the sorry state of our public discourse.</p> <p>Focusing on proven techniques to foster more powerful and effective communication,&nbsp;this audiobook will appeal to listeners looking for both deep insights and practical advice.</p> <p>James Hoggan is president of the Vancouver PR firm Hoggan &amp; Associates, chair of the David Suzuki Foundation board, and founder of the influential website DeSmogBlog.
