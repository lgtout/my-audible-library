window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Following the success of <i>Lean In</i> and <i>Why Women Should Rule the World</i>, the authors of the best-selling <i>Womenomics</i> provide an informative and practical guide to understanding the importance of confidence - and learning how to achieve it - for women of all ages and at all stages of their career. </p> <p>Working women today are better educated and more well-qualified than ever before. Yet men still predominate in the corporate world. In <i>The Confidence Code</i>, Claire Shipman and Katty Kay argue that the key reason is confidence. </p> <p>Combining cutting-edge research in genetics, gender, behavior, and cognition - with examples from their own lives and those of other successful women in politics, media, and business - Kay and Shipman go beyond admonishing women to \"lean in\". Instead, they offer the inspiration and practical advice women need to close the gap and achieve the careers they want and deserve.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
