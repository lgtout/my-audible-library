window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Why do people reject science and believe online conspiracy theories? How are people radicalized online and go on to commit acts of violence? Why is our society so politically polarized?</b></p> <p>Astonishingly irrational ideas are spreading. Covid denial persists in the face of overwhelming evidence. Anti-vaxxers compromise public health. Conspiracy thinking hijacks minds and incites mob violence. Toxic partisanship is cleaving nations, and climate denial has pushed our planet to the brink. Meanwhile, American <i>Nazis</i> march openly in the streets, and <i>Flat Earth</i> theory is back. <i>What the heck is going on?</i> Why is all this happening, and why now? More important, what can we do about it?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Mental Immunity</i>, Andy Norman shows that these phenomena share a root cause. We live in a time when the so-called “right to your opinion” is thought to trump our responsibilities. The resulting ethos effectively compromises mental immune systems, allowing “mind parasites” to overrun them. Conspiracy theories, evidence-defying ideologies, garden-variety bad ideas: these are all species of mind parasite, and each of them employs clever strategies to circumvent mental immune systems. In fact, some of them compromise <i>cultural</i> immune systems - the things societies do to prevent bad ideas from spreading. Norman shows why all of this is more than mere analogy: minds and cultures <i>really do</i> have immune systems, and they <i>really can</i> break down. Fortunately, they can also be built up: strengthened against ideological corruption. He calls for a rigorous science of mental immune health - what he calls “cognitive immunology” - and explains how it could revolutionize our capacity for critical thinking.</p> <p>Hailed as “a feast for thought,” <i>Mental Immunity</i> melds cutting-edge work in science and philosophy into an “astonishingly enlightening and productive” solution to the signature problem of our age. A practical guide to spotting and removing bad ideas, a stirring call to transcend our petty tribalisms, and a serious bid to bring humanity to its senses.</p>";
