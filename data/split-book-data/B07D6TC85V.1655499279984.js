window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Assembled from notes and jottings left unpublished at the time of the author’s death, <i>The Book of Disquiet </i>is a collection of aphoristic prose-poetry musings on dreams, solitude, time and memory. Credited to Pessoa’s alter ego, Bernardo Soares, who chronicles his contemplations in this so-called \"factless\" autobiography, the work is a journey of one man’s soul and, by extension, of all human souls that allow their minds and hearts to roam far and free.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though his outward life as an assistant bookkeeper in downtown Lisbon is a humdrum affair, Soares lives a rich and varied existence within the contours of his own mind, where he can be and do anything. Soares has no ambition, nor has he any friends; he is plagued with disquiet, and only imagination and dreams can conquer it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Compiled by the translator Richard Zenith, Fernando Pessoa’s <i>The Book of Disquiet</i> is a fulgent tribute to the imagination of man. Translation by Richard Zenith.</p>";
