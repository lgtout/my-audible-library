The last of the local mines had closed, businesses were shuttering, and despair was etched in the faces around her. Her father urged her to get out of their blighted corner of northern England: “There is nothing for you here, pet,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;The coal-miner’s daughter managed to go further than he ever could have dreamed. She studied in Moscow and at Harvard, became an American citizen, and served three U.S. Presidents. But in the heartlands of both Russia and the United States, she saw troubling reflections of her hometown and similar populist impulses. By the time she offered her brave testimony in the first&nbsp;impeachment inquiry of President Trump, Hill knew that the desperation of forgotten people was driving American politics over the brink—and that we were running out of time to save ourselves from Russia’s fate. In this powerful, deeply personal account, she shares what she has learned, and shows why expanding opportunity is the only long-term hope for our democracy.</p> <p><b>A&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;Bestseller&nbsp;| A&nbsp;</b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><b>&nbsp;Bestseller&nbsp;| A&nbsp;</b><b><i>Washington Post Notable Book of the Year</i></b>&nbsp;| <b>A&nbsp;</b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;Best Book of the Year</b></p>";
