window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Go beyond your fear of rejection to develop confidence, compassionate self-awareness, and resilience!</b></p> <p>Do you have a fear of rejection? If so, you aren’t alone. But if you have difficulty bouncing back after rejection, experience intense pain as a result, or if the fear of rejection is so crippling that it interferes with your everyday life, it’s time to make a change. This groundbreaking guide can help.</p> <p>With this book, you’ll learn <i>why </i>you fear rejection by gaining an understanding of your unique <i>attachment style</i>. Secure attachment is defined as a feeling of being protected and well-cared for. People who experience secure attachment as young children are more likely to be happy, healthy, and resilient adults. On the other hand, insecurely attached people are less likely to cope well with rejection, and may have trouble “bouncing back” after difficult experiences. Once you understand how your attachment style has informed your fears, you can begin the work needed to overcome them!</p> <p>Using the theory of attachment, and the five domains of awareness: Sensations, Thoughts, Emotions, Actions, and Mentalizing (STEAM), you’ll learn to relate to yourself and to others in more positive ways, even when difficult situations arise. So, whether you experience rejection in a romantic relationship, at work, or with friends, you’ll have the resilience needed to recover quickly and focus on what makes you special and unique.</p> <p>This isn’t a book that promises to protect you from future rejection. Unfortunately, rejection happens to everyone and is a normal part of life. But you <i>will </i>learn skills to handle this rejection and come to see it as less scary. With this view, you’ll gain confidence, self-awareness, and the resilience needed to bounce back, even when life throws you a curveball.</p>";
