window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"A hot lesbian living in the American Southwest decides to grow her own psychoactive mushrooms. 'You'll never guess what happens next!'...In general, this is a balm. It is the polar opposite of that Michael Pollan book.\" (<i>Gossamer</i>)</p> <p><i>The Wild Kindness: A Psilocybin Odyssey</i> is the lyrical, unforgettable memoir of Bett Williams's relationship with psilocybin mushrooms, otherwise known as magic mushrooms. In pursuit of self-healing, she begins experimenting with mushrooms in solitary ceremonies by the fire. Word soon gets out about her New Mexican desert mushroom farm, though, and people arrive in droves. Not long after, the police read her her Miranda Rights, her relationships fall out of whack, and her dog Rosie just might be CIA.&nbsp;</p> <p>On a quest to find help through the psychedelic community, Bett is led to Cleveland to meet Kai Wingo, an African American leader within a high-dose psilocybin community, and to Huautla de Jiménez, home of well-known, well-respected curandera María Sabina. Back home, Bett begins a solid ritual practice with the help of her partner and friends, bearing in mind the medicine's indigenous roots and power to transform one's life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Amidst the mainstream flood of New Age practices and products, <i>The Wild Kindness: A Psilocybin Odyssey</i> is a dreamlike reminder that psilocybin mushrooms are a medicine of the people, not to be neatly packaged, marketed, or appropriated.</p>";
