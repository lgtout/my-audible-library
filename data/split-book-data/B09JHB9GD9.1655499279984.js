window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Human Element</i> is for anyone who wants to introduce a new idea or innovation into the world. Most marketers, innovators, executives, and activists operate on a deep assumption. It is the belief that the best way to convince people to embrace a new idea is to heighten the appeal of the idea itself. We instinctively believe that if we add enough value, people will eventually say \"yes.\" This reflex leads us down a path of adding features and benefits to our ideas or increasing the sizzle of our messaging-all in the hope of getting others on board. We call this instinct the \"Fuel-based mindset.\" The Fuel-based mindset explains so much of what we do, from adding countless trivial features to software, to bolting a sixth blade onto a shaving razor.</p> <p>By focusing on Fuel, innovators neglect the other half of the equation-the psychological Frictions that oppose change. Frictions create drag on innovation. And though they are rarely considered, overcoming these Frictions is essential for bringing new ideas into the world. <i>The Human Element</i> highlights the four Frictions that operate against innovation.</p> <p>Perfect for business leaders, product managers, educators, and anyone else who seeks to bring new and exciting ideas to life, <i>The Human Element</i> is an indispensable resource to help people overcome the powerful forces of human nature that instinctively resist change.</p>";
