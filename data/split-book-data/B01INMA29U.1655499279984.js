window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Obscure and addictive true tales from history told by one of our most entertaining historians, Giles Milton. </p> <p>This program is read by the author, the host of the popular podcast <i>Unknown History with Giles Milton</i>. </p> <p>The first installment in Giles Milton's outrageously entertaining series, History's Unknown Chapters: colorful and accessible, intelligent and illuminating, Milton shows his customary historical flair as he delves into the little-known stories from the past. </p> <p>There's the cook aboard the <i>Titanic</i> who pickled himself with whiskey and survived in the icy seas where most everyone else died. There's the man who survived the atomic bombs in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And there are many, many more. </p> <p>Covering everything from adventure, war, murder, and slavery to espionage, including the stories of the female Robinson Crusoe, Hitler's final hours, Japan's deadly balloon bomb, and the emperor of the United States, these tales deserve to be told. </p>";
