window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Full of revealing, instantly applicable ideas for leveraging your strengths and overcoming your weaknesses.” (Adam Grant, author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Think Again </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Originals</i></b><b>, and host of the TED podcast&nbsp;</b><b><i>WorkLife</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>For many of us, listening is simply something we do on autopilot. We hear just enough of what others say to get our work done, maintain friendships, and be polite with our neighbors. But we miss crucial opportunities to go deeper - to give and receive honest feedback, to make connections that will endure for the long haul, and to discover who people truly are at their core.</p> <p>Fortunately, listening can be improved - and Ximena Vengoechea can show you how. In&nbsp;<i>Listen Like You Mean It</i>, she offers an essential listening guide for our times, revealing tried-and-true strategies honed in her own research sessions and drawn from interviews with marriage counselors, podcast hosts, life coaches, journalists, filmmakers, and other listening experts. Through Vengoechea’s set of scripts, key questions, and exercises, you’ll learn to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Quickly build rapport with strangers</li> <li>Ask the right questions to deepen a conversation</li> <li>Pause at the right time to encourage vulnerability</li> <li>Navigate a conversation that’s gone off the rails</li> </ul> <p>Now more than ever, we need to feel heard, connected, and understood in a world that keeps turning up the volume. Warm, funny, and immensely practical, this book shows you how.</p> <p><b>*&nbsp;This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF of illustrations, charts, and exercises.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
