window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Over the past 25 years, our quest for thinness has morphed into a relentless obsession with weight and body image. In our culture \"fat\" has become a four-letter word. Or, as Lance Armstrong said to the wife of a former teammate, \"I called you crazy. I called you a bitch. But I never called you fat.\" How did we get to this place where the worst insult you can hurl at someone is \"fat\"? Where women and girls (and increasingly men and boys) will diet, purge, overeat, undereat, and berate themselves and others all in the name of being thin? </p> <p>As a science journalist, Harriet Brown has explored this collective longing and fixation from an objective perspective; as a mother, wife, and woman with \"weight issues\", she has struggled to understand it on a personal level. Now, in <i>Body of Truth</i>, Brown systematically unpacks what's been offered as \"truth\" about weight and health. </p> <p>Starting with the four biggest lies, Brown shows how research has been manipulated; how the medical profession is complicit in keeping us in the dark; how big pharma and big, empty promises equal big, big dollars; how much of what we know (or think we know) about health and weight is wrong. And how all of those affect all of us every day, whether we know it or not. The quest for health and wellness has never been more urgent, yet most of us continue to buy in to fad diets and unattainable body ideals, unaware of the damage we're doing to ourselves. </p> <p>Through interviews, research, and her own experience, Brown not only gives us the real story on weight, health, and beauty but also offers concrete suggestions for how each of us can sort through the lies and misconceptions and make peace with and for ourselves. </p>";
