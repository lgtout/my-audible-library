window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Unabridged and available on audio for the first time</b></p> <p>Simone de Beauvoir’s essential masterwork is a powerful analysis of the Western notion of \"woman\", and a revolutionary exploration of inequality and otherness. This unabridged edition of the text reinstates significant portions of the original French text that were cut in the first English translation, and is now available on audio for the very first time. Vital and groundbreaking, Beauvoir’s pioneering and impressive text remains as pertinent today as when it was first published, and will continue to provoke and inspire generations of men and women to come.</p>";
