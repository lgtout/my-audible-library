window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Renowned poet and critic Clive James presents the crowning achievement of his career: a monumental translation into English verse of Dante’s <i>The Divine Comedy.</i> </p> <p><i>The Divine Comedy</i> is the precursor of modern literature, and this translation - decades in the making - gives us the entire epic as a single, coherent and compulsively listenable lyric poem. Written in the early 14th century and completed in 1321, the year of Dante’s death, <i>The Divine Comedy</i> is perhaps the greatest work of epic poetry ever composed. </p> <p>Divided into three books - <i>Hell, Purgatory</i> and <i>Heaven</i> - the poem’s allegorical vision of the afterlife portrays the poet’s spiritual crisis in terms of his own contemporary history, in a text of such vivid life and variety that modern readers will find themselves astounded in a hundred different ways. And indeed the structure of this massive single song is divided into a hundred songs, or cantos, each of which is a separate poetic miracle. But unifying them all is the impetus of the Italian verse: a verbal energy that Clive James has now brought into English. </p> <p>For its range of emotion alone, Clive James’s poetic rendering of <i>The Divine Comedy</i> would be without precedent. But it is also singled out by its sheer readability. The result is the epic as a page-turner, a work that will influence the way we read Dante in English for generations to come.</p> <p><i>The Divine Comedy</i> is performed by Edoardo Ballerini (2013 Audie Award winner, Best Solo Narration - Male), who had this to say about the book and his experience narrating it: \"There are literary classics, and then then are those few books that serve as the cultural foundation for all of western civilization. Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> is one of those rarified titles. Being asked to narrate such a monumental work was an honor, and one of the highlights of my career, across film, TV, stage and audio. It was a humbling experience, and I only hope this recording inspires listeners to experience this profoundly beautiful work of art in a new, accessible and playful way.\"</p>";
