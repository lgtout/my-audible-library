window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> is D. H. Lawrence's last novel. First published privately in 1928, <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> was banned from wider publication in the UK until 1960 and was the subject of censorship and book banning in the United States and elsewhere. Its erotic subject material, colorful language, and discussion of interclass relations were deemed obscene. </p> <p>Now deemed a classic work of artistic merit written before its time, D.H. Lawrence's thoughtfully penned novel scrutinizes marriage, infidelity, and the things people do to achieve physical and emotional happiness. The novel's frank approach to sex and desire infuses <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> with a modern sensibility that rings as true and thought-provoking in the present as upon its first scandalous publication. </p>";
