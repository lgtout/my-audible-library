window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Shadow over Innsmouth</i> and <i>The Whisperer in Darkness</i> are counted among H. P. Lovecraft's most popular stories. In the first we are transported to the decrepit coastal town of Innsmouth, whose amphibianlike citizens betray a dark and sinister secret. The second takes us to Vermont, where a university professor becomes embroiled in a mind-bending celestial mystery after strange things are seen floating in the rivers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dark, brooding, and suspenseful, this is Lovecraft at his very best.&nbsp;</p>";
