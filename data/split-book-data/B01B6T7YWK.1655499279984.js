window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Everyone Anton Waker grew up with is corrupt. His parents dealt in stolen goods, and he was a successful purveyor of forged documents until he abandoned it all in his early 20s, determined to live a normal life complete with a career, an apartment, and a fiancée who knows nothing of his criminal beginnings. He's on the verge of finally getting married when Aria - his cousin and former partner in crime - blackmails him into helping her with one last job. </p> <p>Anton considers the task a small price for future freedom. But as he sets off for an Italian honeymoon, it soon becomes clear that the ghosts of his past can't be left behind so easily and that the task Aria requires will cost him more than he could ever imagine. </p>";
