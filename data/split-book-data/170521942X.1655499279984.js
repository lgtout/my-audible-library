window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The great human quest is to discover who we really are-a discovery that changes our lives and the lives of those around us. With <i>The Deep Heart</i>, spiritual teacher and psychotherapist Dr. John J. Prendergast invites us on a pilgrimage within.</p> <p>The \"deep heart\" is Prendergast's term for our heart center-a subtle center of emotional and energetic sensitivity, relational intimacy, profound inner knowing, and unconditional love. \"The heart area is where we feel most deeply touched by kindness, gratitude, and appreciation, yet it is also where we feel most emotionally wounded,\" writes Prendergast. \"Whether we realize it or not, the heart is what we most carefully guard and most want to open.\"</p> <p>Throughout <i>The Deep Heart</i>, Prendergast expertly combines the boundaried wisdom of psychotherapy with a spacious, embodied path to liberation, bringing attention to both the joys and pitfalls of each approach. In this experiential guide, Prendergast invites you to tune into your inherent wisdom, love, and wholeness as you journey into the deep heart.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through precise and potent meditative inquiries, insightful stories, and reflections drawn from Prendergast's intimate work with students and clients, you'll begin to open your heart, see through your core limiting beliefs, and discover the true nature of your being.</p>";
