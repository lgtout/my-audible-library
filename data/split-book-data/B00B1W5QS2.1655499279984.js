window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Passionate, strong-minded nonfiction from the National Book Award-winning author of <i>The Corrections.</i> </b></p> <p>Jonathan Franzen's <i>The Corrections</i> was the best-loved and most-written-about novel of 2001. Nearly every in-depth review of it discussed what became known as \"The <i>Harper's</i> Essay\", Franzen's controversial 1996 investigation of the fate of the American novel. This essay is available in audio for the first time in <i>How to be Alone,</i> along with the personal essays and the dead-on reportage that earned Franzen a wide readership before the success of <i>The Corrections.</i> </p> <p>Although his subjects range from the sex-advice industry to the way a supermax prison works, each piece wrestles with familiar themes of Franzen's writing: the erosion of civic life and private dignity and the hidden persistence of loneliness in postmodern, imperial America. Recent pieces include a moving essay on his father's stuggle with Alzheimer's disease (which has already been reprinted around the world) and a rueful account of Franzen's brief tenure as an Oprah Winfrey author. </p> <p>As a collection, these essays record what Franzen calls \"a movement away from an angry and frightened isolation toward an acceptance - even a celebration - of being a reader and a writer.\" At the same time they show the wry distrust of the claims of technology and psychology, the love-hate relationship with consumerism, and the subversive belief in the tragic shape of the individual life that help make Franzen one of our sharpest, toughest, and most entertaining social critics.</p>";
