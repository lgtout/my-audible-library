window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“A debut poetry collection showcasing both a fierce and tender new voice.” (<i>Booklist</i>)</p> <p>“Elegant and playful...The poet invents new forms and updates classic ones.” (<i>Elle</i>)</p> <p>Named one of the top 10 books of the year by the New York Public Library.</p> <p>Finalist for the Lambda Literary Award&nbsp;</p> <p><i>An aunt teaches me how to tell an edible flower from a poisonous one. Just in case, I hear her say, just in case.</i></p> <p>From a co-creator of the Emmy-nominated web series <i>Brown Girls</i> comes an imaginative, soulful debut poetry collection that captures the experiences of being a young Pakistani Muslim woman in contemporary America.&nbsp;</p> <p>Orphaned as a child, Fatimah Asghar grapples with coming of age and navigating questions of sexuality and race without the guidance of a mother or father. These poems at once bear anguish, joy, vulnerability, and compassion, while also exploring the many facets of violence: how it persists within us, how it is inherited across generations, and how it manifests itself in our relationships. In experimental forms and language both lyrical and raw, Asghar seamlessly braids together marginalized people’s histories with her own understanding of identity, place, and belonging.</p> <p>Praise for <i>If They Come for Us</i></p> <p>“In forms both traditional...and unorthodox...Asghar interrogates divisions along lines of nationality, age, and gender, illuminating the forces by which identity is fixed or flexible. Most vivid and revelatory are pieces such as ‘Boy,’ whose perspicacious turns and irreverent idiom conjure the rich, jagged textures of a childhood shadowed by loss.” (<i>The New Yorker</i>)</p> <p>“This summer, [Asghar’s] debut poetry collection cemented her status as one of the city’s greatest present-day poets.... A stunning work of art that tackles place, race, sexuality and violence. These poems - both personal and historical, both celebratory and aggrieved - are unquestionably powerful in a way that would doubtless make both Gwendolyn Brooks and Harriet Monroe proud.” (<i>Chicago Review of Books</i>)</p>";
