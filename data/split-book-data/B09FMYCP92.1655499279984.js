window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One of America’s top physicians traces the history of risk in medicine - with powerful lessons for today.</b></p> <p>Every medical decision - whether to have chemotherapy, an X-ray, or surgery - is a risk, no matter which way you choose. In <i>You Bet Your Life</i>, physician Paul A. Offit argues that, from the first blood transfusions 400 years ago to the hunt for a COVID-19 vaccine, risk has been essential to the discovery of new treatments. More importantly, understanding the risks is crucial to whether, as a society or as individuals, we accept them.</p> <p>Told in Offit’s vigorous and rigorous style, <i>You Bet Your Life </i>is an entertaining history of medicine. But it also lays bare the tortured relationships between intellectual breakthroughs, political realities, and human foibles. Our pandemic year has shown us, with its debates over lockdowns, masks, and vaccines, how easy it is to get everything wrong. <i>You Bet Your Life </i>is an essential listen for getting the future a bit more right.</p>";
