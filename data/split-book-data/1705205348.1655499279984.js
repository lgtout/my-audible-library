window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Despite 21st-century fears of an \"epidemic\" of loneliness, its history has been sorely neglected. <i>A Biography of Loneliness</i> offers a radically new interpretation of loneliness as an emotional language and experience.&nbsp;</p> <p>Using letters and diaries, philosophical tracts, political discussions, and medical literature from the 18th century to the present, historian of the emotions Fay Bound Alberti argues that loneliness is not a historical, universal phenomenon. It is, in fact, a modern emotion: before 1800, its language did not exist. And where loneliness is identified, it is not always bad, but a complex emotional state that differs according to class, gender, ethnicity, and experience.&nbsp;</p> <p>Looking at informative case studies such as Sylvia Plath, Queen Victoria, and Virginia Woolf, <i>A Biography of Loneliness</i> charts the emergence of loneliness as a modern and embodied emotional state.</p>";
