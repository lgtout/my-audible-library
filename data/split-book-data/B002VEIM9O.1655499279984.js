Greene is a founder of the conservative group rightmarch.com. According to the group's website, rightmarch.com \"is an umbrella website for many conservative organizations.\" The group has launched media and email campaigns, some of them against Moveon.org. They are planning on sponsoring TV ads criticizing the liberal group. One of the group's members recently released a country song entitled \"Hey Hollywood.\" The song pokes fun at so-called \"liberal\" actors and country musicians, like Willie Nelson and The Dixie Chicks, who speak out against the war in Iraq. </p><p>Wes Boyd and Eli Pariser are members of the liberal group Moveon.org. The group was founded by Boyd and Joan Blades, two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, in the late 90s as a liberal political force. MoveOn recently sponsored the \"Bush in 30 Seconds\" ad contest. Some 1500 contestants submitted ads and over 100,000 people voted for them online. Moveon.org is raising money to air the winning ad on TV this week. The organization is even trying to get the ad aired during the Super Bowl. (Broadcast Date: January 21, 2004) </p>";
