window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A masterful introduction to the key ideas behind the successes - and failures - of free-market economics </b></p> <p>Since 1946, Henry Hazlitt's best-selling <i>Economics in One Lesson</i> has popularized the belief that economics can be boiled down to one simple lesson: market prices represent the true cost of everything. But one-lesson economics tells only half the story. It can explain why markets often work so well, but it can't explain why they often fail so badly - or what we should do when they stumble. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson quipped, \"When someone preaches 'economics in one lesson', I advise: go back for the second lesson.\" In <i>Economics in Two Lessons</i>, John Quiggin teaches both lessons, offering a masterful introduction to the key ideas behind the successes - and failures - of free markets.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Economics in Two Lessons</i> explains why market prices often fail to reflect the full cost of our choices to society as a whole. For example, every time we drive a car, fly in a plane, or flick a light switch, we contribute to global warming. But, in the absence of a price on carbon emissions, the costs of our actions are borne by everyone else. In such cases, government action is needed to achieve better outcomes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two-lesson economics means giving up the dogmatism of laissez-faire as well as the reflexive assumption that any economic problem can be solved by government action, since the right answer often involves a mixture of market forces and government policy. But the payoff is huge: understanding how markets actually work - and what to do when they don't.&nbsp;</p> <p>Brilliantly accessible, <i>Economics in Two Lessons</i> unlocks the essential issues at the heart of any economic question.</p>";
