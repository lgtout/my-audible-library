window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Men Explain Things to Me</i>, Rebecca Solnit takes on the conversations between men who wrongly assume they know things and wrongly assume women don't. The ultimate problem, she shows in her comic, scathing essay, is female self-doubt and the silencing of women. Writer, historian, and activist Rebecca Solnit is the author of 14 books about civil society, popular power, uprisings, art, environment, place, pleasure, politics, hope, and memory, most recently <i>The Faraway Nearby</i>, a book on empathy and storytelling. She is a <i>Harper's Magazine</i> contributing editor.</p>";
