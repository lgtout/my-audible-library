window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Richard Louv has done it again. A remarkable book that will help everyone break away from their fixed gaze at the screens that dominate our lives and remember instead that we are animals in a world of animals.\" (Bill McKibben, author of </b><b><i>Falter</i></b><b>)&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Richard Louv's landmark book, <i>Last Child in the Woods</i>, inspired an international movement to connect children and nature. Now Louv redefines the future of human-animal coexistence. <i>Our Wild Calling </i>explores these powerful and mysterious bonds and how they can transform our mental, physical, and spiritual lives, serve as an antidote to the growing epidemic of human loneliness, and help us tap into the empathy required to preserve life on Earth. Louv interviews researchers, theologians, wildlife experts, indigenous healers, psychologists, and others to show how people are communicating with animals in ancient and new ways; how dogs can teach children ethical behavior; how animal-assisted therapy may yet transform the mental health field; and what role the human-animal relationship plays in our spiritual health. He reports on wildlife relocation and on how the growing populations of wild species in urban areas are blurring the lines between domestic and wild animals.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Our Wild Calling </i>makes the case for protecting, promoting, and creating a sustainable and shared habitat for all creatures - not out of fear, but out of love. Transformative and inspiring, this book points us toward what we all long for in the age of technology: real connection.</p>";
