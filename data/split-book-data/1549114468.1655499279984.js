window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>How both logical and emotional reasoning can help us live better in our post-truth world</b></p> <p>In a world where fake news stories change election outcomes, has rationality become futile? In<i> The Art of Logic in an Illogical World, </i>Eugenia Cheng throws a lifeline to listeners drowning in the illogic of contemporary life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cheng is a mathematician, so she knows how to make an airtight argument. But even for her, logic sometimes falls prey to emotion, which is why she still fears flying and eats more cookies than she should. If a mathematician can't be logical, what are we to do?&nbsp;</p> <p>In this audiobook<i>, </i>Cheng reveals the inner workings and limitations of logic and explains why alogic - for example, emotion - is vital to how we think and communicate. Cheng shows us how to use logic and alogic together to navigate a world awash in bigotry, mansplaining, and manipulative memes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Insightful, useful, and funny, this essential audiobook is for anyone who wants to think more clearly.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
