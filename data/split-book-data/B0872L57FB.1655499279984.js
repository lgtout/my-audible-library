window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We tend to isolate the things we know in the domain we learned it. For example:</p> <ul> <li>What does the inertia of a rolling stone have to do with perseverance and being open-minded?</li> <li>How can the ancient process of steel production make you a more creative and innovative thinker?</li> <li>What does the replication of our skin cells have to do with being a stronger and more effective leader?</li> </ul> <p>On the surface, these concepts may appear to be dissimilar and unrelated. But the surprising truth is the hard sciences (physics, chemistry, and biology) offer a wealth of useful tools you can use to develop critically important skills like:</p> <ul> <li>Relationship building</li> <li>Leadership</li> <li>Communication</li> <li>Creativity</li> <li>Curiosity</li> <li>Problem-solving</li> <li>Decision-making</li> </ul> <p>This second volume of the Great Mental Models series shows you how to make those connections. It explores the core ideas from the hard sciences and offers nearly two dozen models to add to your mental toolbox.</p> <p>You'll not only get a better understanding of the forces that influence the world around you, but you'll learn how to direct those forces to create outsized advantages in the areas of your life that matter most to you.</p>";
