window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling author of <i>The Small Backs of Children</i> offers a vision of our near extinction and a heroine - a reimagined Joan of Arc - poised to save a world ravaged by war, violence, and greed and forever change history in this provocative new novel. </p> <p>In the near future, world wars have transformed the earth into a battleground. Fleeing the unending violence and the planet's now-radioactive surface, humans have regrouped on a mysterious platform known as CIEL, hovering over their erstwhile home. The changed world has turned evolution on its head: The surviving humans have become sexless, hairless, pale-white creatures floating in isolation, inscribing stories upon their skin. </p> <p>Out of the ranks of the endless wars rises Jean de Men, a charismatic and bloodthirsty cult leader who turns CIEL into a quasicorporate police state. A group of rebels unite to dismantle his iron rule - galvanized by the heroic song of Joan, a child warrior who possesses a mysterious force that lives within her and communes with the earth. When de Men and his armies turn Joan into a martyr, the consequences are astonishing. And no one - not the rebels, Jean de Men, or even Joan herself - can foresee the way her story and unique gift will forge the destiny of an entire world for generations. </p> <p>A riveting tale of destruction and love found in the direst of places - even at the extreme end of posthuman experience - Lidia Yuknavitch's <i>The Book of Joan</i> raises questions about what it means to be human, the fluidity of sex and gender, and the role of art as a means for survival. </p>";
