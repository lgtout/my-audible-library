window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A distinguished religious leader's stirring case for reconstructing a shared framework of virtues and values.</b></p> <p>With liberal democracy embattled, public discourse grown toxic, family life breaking down, and drug abuse and depression on the rise, many fear what the future holds.</p> <p>In <i>Morality</i>, respected faith leader and public intellectual Jonathan Sacks traces today's crisis to our loss of a strong, shared moral code and our elevation of self-interest over the common good. We have outsourced morality to the market and the state, but neither is capable of showing us how to live. Sacks leads listeners from ancient Greece to the Enlightenment to the present day to show that there is no liberty without morality and no freedom without responsibility, arguing that we all must must play our part in rebuilding a common moral foundation.</p> <p>A major work of moral philosophy, <i>Morality</i> is an inspiring vision of a world in which we can all find our place and face the future without fear.</p>";
