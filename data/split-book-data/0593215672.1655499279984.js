window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Climate change: It is arguably the most urgent and consequential issue humankind has ever faced. How we address it in the next 30 years will determine the kind of world we will live in and will bequeath to our children and to theirs.</p> <p>In <i>The Future We Choose</i>, Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac - who led negotiations for the United Nations during the historic Paris Agreement of 2015 - have written a cautionary but optimistic audiobook about the world's changing climate and the fate of humanity. The authors outline two possible scenarios for our planet. In one, they describe what life on Earth will be like by 2050 if we fail to meet the Paris climate targets. In the other, they lay out what it will be like to live in a carbon neutral, regenerative world. They argue for confronting the climate crisis head-on, with determination and optimism.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Future We Choose</i> presents our options and tells us what governments, corporations, and each of us can and must do to fend off disaster.&nbsp;</p>";
