window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Modern humans have come a long way in the 70,000 years they’ve walked the earth. Art, science, culture, trade - on the evolutionary food chain, we’re true winners. But it hasn’t always been smooth sailing, and sometimes - just occasionally - we’ve managed to truly f--k things up.</p> <p>Weaving together history, science, politics, and pop culture, <i>Humans</i> offers a panoramic exploration of humankind in all its glory, or lack thereof. From Lucy, our first ancestor, who fell out of a tree and died, to General Zhou Shou of China, who stored gunpowder in his palace before a lantern festival, to the Austrian army attacking<i> itself</i> one drunken night, to the most spectacular fails of the present day, <i>Humans</i> reveals how even the most mundane mistakes can shift the course of civilization as we know it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lively, wry, and brimming with brilliant insight, this unique compendium offers a fresh take on world history and is one of the most entertaining listens of the year.</p>";
