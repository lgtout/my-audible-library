window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An essential guide for recognizing, preventing, and healing childhood trauma from infancy through adolescence - what parents, educators, and health professionals can do.</b></p> <p>Trauma can result not only from catastrophic events such as abuse, violence, or loss of loved ones, but from natural disasters and everyday incidents like auto accidents, medical procedures, divorce, or even falling off a bicycle. At the core of this audiobook is the understanding of how trauma is imprinted on the body, brain, and spirit - often resulting in anxiety, nightmares, depression, physical illnesses, addictions, hyperactivity, and aggression.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rich with case studies and hands-on activities, <i>Trauma Through a Child’s Eyes</i> gives insight into children’s innate ability to rebound with the appropriate support and provides their caregivers with tools to overcome and prevent trauma.</p>";
