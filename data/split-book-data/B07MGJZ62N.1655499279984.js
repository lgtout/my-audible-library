window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This program includes a foreword read by the author.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The first explosive audiobook about Javanka and their infamous rise to power.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are the self-styled prince and princess of America. Their swift, gilded rise to extraordinary power in Donald Trump’s White House is unprecedented, unconstitutional, and dangerous. In <i>Kushner, Inc.</i>, investigative journalist Vicky Ward digs beneath the myth the couple has created that depicts themselves as the voices of reason in an otherwise crazy presidency and reveals that Jared and Ivanka are not just the president’s chief enablers, they are, like him, disdainful of rules, of laws, and of ethics. They are entitled inheritors of the worst kind; their combination of ignorance, arrogance, and an insatiable lust for power has caused havoc all over the world and threatens the democracy of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Ward follows their trajectory from New Jersey and New York City to the White House, where the couple’s many forays into policy making and national security have mocked long-standing US policy and protocol. They have pursued a personal agenda that is making them very rich while their actions have mostly gone unchecked. In <i>Kushner, Inc.</i>, Ward holds Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump accountable: She unveils the couple’s secret self-serving transactional motivations and how those have propelled them into the highest levels of the US government where no one, the president included, has been able to stop them.</p>";
