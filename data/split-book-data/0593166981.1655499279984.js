In <i>Deacon King Kong</i>, McBride brings to vivid life the people affected by the shooting: the victim, the African American and Latinx residents who witnessed it, the White neighbors, the local cops assigned to investigate, the members of the Five Ends Baptist Church where Sportcoat was deacon, the neighborhood's Italian mobsters, and Sportcoat himself.</p> <p>As the story deepens, it becomes clear that the lives of the characters - caught in the tumultuous swirl of 1960s New York - overlap in unexpected ways. When the truth does emerge, McBride shows us that not all secrets are meant to be hidden, that the best way to grow is to face change without fear, and that the seeds of love lie in hope and compassion.</p> <p>Bringing both his masterly storytelling skills and his abiding faith in humanity, James McBride has written a novel every bit as involving as <i>The Good Lord Bird</i> and as emotionally honest as <i>The Color of Water</i>. Told with insight and wit, <i>Deacon King Kong</i> demonstrates that love and faith live in all of us.</p>";
