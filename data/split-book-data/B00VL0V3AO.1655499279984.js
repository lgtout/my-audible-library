window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The get ready, get going guide to navigating career change and doing work you love! </p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jon Acuff has drawn millions of online fans who love his refreshing mix of humor, honesty, and wisdom about the world of work. Now he offers his most important audiobook yet, a guide to making big career changes - by choice or necessity - and escaping the horrible feeling of being trapped in the wrong job. </p> <p>Acuff finds it amazing that people spend more than 18 years studying and preparing for college but little or no time honing their careers between graduation and retirement. He offers an empowering tool he calls the Career Savings Account, which will change the way you think about your skills, relationships, character, and work ethic. He also shows that if you're on the wrong track, you already have what you need to change it - even if your family and mortgage mean you can't simply pick up and move for a new opportunity. </p> <p>Throughout the book, Acuff features inspiring and funny true stories - not merely his own but those of friends who restarted their careers after a layoff, an extended maternity leave, or simply the realization that they were suffering 50 weeks a year just to pay the bills and enjoy two weeks of vacation. Everyone can benefit from <i>Do Over</i>, from new graduates to 50-somethings and beyond. </p>";
