window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The number one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller and a</b><b><i> USA Today </i></b><b>best seller!</b></p> <p><b>A timely, crucial, and empowering exploration of racism - and antiracism - in America</b></p> <p><i>This is NOT a history book.</i><br> <i>This is a book about the here and now. </i><br> <i>A book to help us better understand why we are where we are.</i><br> <i>A book about race. </i></p> <p>The construct of race has always been used to gain and keep power, to create dynamics that separate and silence. This remarkable reimagining of Dr. Ibram X. Kendi's National Book Award-winning <i>Stamped from the Beginning</i> reveals the history of racist ideas in America, and inspires hope for an antiracist future. It takes you on a race journey from then to now, shows you why we feel how we feel, and why the poison of racism lingers. It also proves that while racist ideas have always been easy to fabricate and distribute, they can also be discredited.&nbsp;</p> <p>Through a gripping, fast-paced, and energizing narrative written by beloved award-winner Jason Reynolds, this book shines a light on the many insidious forms of racist ideas - and on ways listeners can identify and stamp out racist thoughts in their daily lives.</p>";
