window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earphones Award Winner (</b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>Exclusively from Audible</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Set on Egdon Heath, a fictional barren moor in Wessex, Eustacia Vye longs for the excitement of city life but is cut off from the world in her grandfather's lonely cottage. Clym Yeobright who has returned to the area to become a schoolmaster seems to offer everything she dreams of: passion, excitement and the opportunity to escape. However, Clym's ambitions are quite different from hers, and marriage only increases Eustacia's destructive restlessness, drawing others into a tangled web of deceit and unhappiness.&nbsp;</p> <p>Considered a truly modern story due to its sexual politics and hindered desires it still holds relevance to audiences today. There is a tension between the symbolic setting of the heath and the modernity of the characters that makes the listener question our freedom to shape our lives as we wish. Are we always able to live our dreams?&nbsp;</p> <p>Like George Eliot, Hardy was a Victorian realist whose novels and poetry were greatly influenced by Romanticism, especially the poet William Wordsworth. His critical thoughts on Victorian society can be seen throughout much of his work.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Narrator Biography</i>&nbsp;</p> <p>Multi-award winning actor and director Alan Rickman, famous for roles such as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films and the Sherriff of Nottingham in <i>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</i> (1991), had a varied career that included performing on stage with the Royal Shakespeare Company in modern and classical theatre productions. In America, he gained recognition for his Broadway appearance in <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i> (1985) and later his role in <i>Die Hard</i> (1988) made him internationally famous. Other notable performances included his 2001 return to the West End and Broadway in Noël Coward's <i>Private Lives</i> and Ibsen's <i>John Gabriel Borkman</i> in 2010. Rickman is most remembered for his roles in films such as <i>Love Actually</i> (2003) and <i>Sweeney Todd</i> (2007) as well as voicing Marvin the Paranoid Android in <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> (2005), and Absalom the Caterpillar in Tim Burton's <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> (2010).&nbsp;</p>";
