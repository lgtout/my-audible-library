window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Statistics show that 50 percent of what determines divorce is genetic temperament. And, if you are one of the 20 percent of people who are born highly sensitive, the risk of an unhappy relationship is especially high. Your finely tuned nervous system, which picks up on subtleties and reflects deeply, would be a romantic asset if both you and your partner understood you better. But without that understanding, your sensitivity is likely to be making your close relationships painful and complicated. </p> <p>Based on Elaine N. Aron's groundbreaking research on temperament and intimacy, <i>The Highly Sensitive Person in Love</i> offers practical help for highly sensitive people seeking happier, healthier romantic relationships. From low-stress fighting to sensitive sexuality, the book offers a wealth of practical advice on making the most of all personality combinations. Complete with illuminating self-tests and the results of the first survey ever done on sex and temperament, <i>The Highly Sensitive Person in Love </i>will help you discover a better way of living and loving. </p>";
