window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The world's leading intellectual offers a probing examination of the waning American century, the nature of US policies post-9/11, and the perils of valuing power above democracy and human rights. </p> <p>In an incisive, thorough analysis of the current international situation, Noam Chomsky argues that the United States, through its military-first policies and its unstinting devotion to maintaining a world-spanning empire, is both risking catastrophe and wrecking the global commons. Drawing on a wide range of examples, from the expanding drone assassination program to the threat of nuclear warfare as well as the flashpoints of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Israel/Palestine, he offers unexpected and nuanced insights into the workings of imperial power on our increasingly chaotic planet. </p> <p>In the process Chomsky provides a brilliant anatomy of just how US elites have grown ever more insulated from any democratic constraints on their power. While the broader population is lulled into apathy - diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable - the corporations and the rich have increasingly been allowed to do as they please. </p> <p>Fierce, unsparing, and meticulously documented, <i>Who Rules the World?</i> delivers the indispensable understanding of the central conflicts and dangers of our time that we have come to expect from Chomsky. </p>";
