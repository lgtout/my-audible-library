window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before it was a religion, a culture, or even a system of meditation, what was Buddhism? On <i>Buddhism Without Beliefs,</i> celebrated teacher, translator, and former Buddhist monk Stephen Batchelor takes us back to the first years after the Buddha's awakening to reveal the root insights of Buddhism hidden beneath centuries of history and interpretation. </p> <p>In eight compelling sessions of self-inquiry - including many fascinating exercises and practices - we learn how to awaken and refine our senses, introduce the essential spirit of curiosity into the practice of awareness, and comprehend with both our hearts and our minds the Buddha's astonishing (and often misunderstood) revelations on emptiness, compassion, and the self. Before he died, the Buddha did not appoint a successor. He simply remarked that each of us must be responsible for our own freedom. </p> <p><i>Buddhism without Beliefs</i> is an invitation to hear what the Buddha taught - and to trust yourself on your own path to liberation.</p>";
