window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p>We are all bombarded with advice about what we should and shouldn’t eat, and new scientific discoveries are announced every day. Yet the more we are told about nutrition, the less we seem to understand.</p> <p>Through his pioneering scientific research, Tim Spector has been shocked to discover how little good evidence there is for many of our most deep-rooted ideas about food. In a series of short, myth-busting chapters, <i>Spoon-Fed</i> reveals why almost everything we’ve been told about food is wrong. Spector explores the scandalous lack of good science behind many medical and government food recommendations and how the food industry holds sway over these policies and our choices.</p> <p><i>Spoon-Fed </i>is a groundbreaking book that forces us to question every diet plan, official recommendation, miracle cure or food label we encounter and encourages us to rethink our whole relationship with food.</p> <p>Diet may be the most important medicine we all possess. We urgently need to learn how best to use it, not just for our health as individuals, but for the future of the planet.</p>";
