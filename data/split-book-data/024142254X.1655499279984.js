window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brought to you by Penguin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This Penguin Classic is performed by Juliet Aubrey, who won the BAFTA for Best Actress for her role as Dorothea in the BBC serial Middlemarch. This definitive recording includes an Introduction by Rosemary Ashton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>George Eliot's most ambitious novel is a masterly evocation of diverse lives and changing fortunes in a provincial community. Peopling its landscape are Dorothea Brooke, a young idealist whose search for intellectual fulfillment leads her into a disastrous marriage to the pedantic scholar Casaubon; the charming but tactless Dr Lydgate, whose marriage to the spendthrift beauty Rosamund and pioneering medical methods threaten to undermine his career; and the religious hypocrite Bulstrode, hiding scandalous crimes from his past.</p>";
