window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the words of the Buddha, the four foundations of mindfulness (the four satipatthanas) are \"the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of dukkha (suffering) and discontent, for acquiring the true method, for the realization of Nibbana.\" Within the quintessential discourse called the Satipatthana Sutta, we find the Buddha's seminal teachings about the practice of meditation. </p> <p>On <i>Abiding in Mindfulness, Volume I: The Body,</i> esteemed teacher and author Joseph Goldstein presents an audio curriculum to reveal the deeper insights of this vital sutta - and how it serves to inform and guide your own daily practice. </p> <p>Goldstein sets the stage for your journey through the sutta by clarifying the Buddha's initial declaration of the \"direct path\" to awakening that is its promise. Through the wisdom of Buddhist masters of ancient and modern times and the expertise of his own 40-year study and practice, he shares the subtle nuances of each key term derived from the original Pali. Where do you find the ardency to sustain and balance your efforts along the path? How do you cultivate the breadth of mindfulness that makes any spiritual undertaking possible? What strengthens your perception of impermanence - both internally and externally? </p> <p>With Goldstein's lucid instruction, you will discover a wellspring of profound revelations to revitalize and mature your practice, and help you bring forth its fruits in every area of your life. </p> <p>Course objectives:</p> <ul> <li>Explore the four abidings of mindfulness, or qualities of mind, as the direct path for awakening</li> <li>Observe the three kinds of cravings and desires, and how they manifest</li> <li>Analyze how mindfulness of the body is the first foundation of mindfulness as taught by the Buddha</li> <li>Discuss the ways of clearly knowing and the four basic qualities of matter in relationship to the relative (objective or conceptual) and the ultimate (subjective or direct) levels of experience or truth</li> </ul> <p>On <i>Abiding in Mindfulness, Volume I: The Body,</i> Goldstein introduces you to the first satipatthana, the domain of the body. Here, you will learn the cornerstone techniques for successful meditation practice, as taught by the Buddha himself. </p> <p>From appropriate places and postures for practice to clear comprehension of all aspects of the body to the elements and energies that make up our physical form, Goldstein brings you to the threshold of the \"ultimate truth\" of our bodies.</p>";
