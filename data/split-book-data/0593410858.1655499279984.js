In a fiercely personal account written from inside the climate movement, Sherrell lays bare how the crisis is transforming our relationships to time, to hope, and to each other. At once a memoir, a love letter, and an electric work of criticism, <i>Warmth</i> goes to the heart of the defining question of our time: how do we go on in a world that may not?</p>";
