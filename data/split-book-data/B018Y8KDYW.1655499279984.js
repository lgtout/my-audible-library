window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Part psychological study, part self-help book, <i>Finding Flow</i> is a prescriptive guide that helps us reclaim ownership of our lives. </p> <p>Based on a far-reaching study of thousands of individuals, <i>Finding Flow</i> contends that we often walk through our days unaware of and out of touch with our emotional lives. Our inattention makes us constantly bounce between two extremes: During much of the day, we live filled with the anxiety and pressures of our work and obligations, and during our leisure moments, we tend to live in passive boredom. The key, according to Csikszentmihalyi, is to challenge ourselves with tasks requiring a high degree of skill and commitment. Instead of watching television, play the piano. Transform a routine task by taking a different approach. In short, learn the joy of complete engagement. Though they appear simple, the lessons in <i>Finding Flow</i> are life altering. </p>";
