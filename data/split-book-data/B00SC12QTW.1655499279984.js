window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling author of <i>Free Radicals</i> takes listeners on a whirlwind tour of the most controversial areas of modern science. </p> <p>The atom, the big bang, DNA, natural selection - all are ideas that have revolutionized science; and all were dismissed out of hand when they first appeared. The surprises haven't stopped in recent years, and in <i>At the Edge of Uncertainty</i>, best-selling author Michael Brooks investigates the new wave of radical insights that are shaping the future of scientific discovery. </p> <p>Brooks takes us to the extreme frontiers of what we understand about the world. He journeys from the observations that might rewrite our story of how the cosmos came to be, through the novel biology behind our will to live, and on to the physiological root of consciousness. Along the way, he examines how it's time to redress the gender imbalance in clinical trials, explores how merging humans with other species might provide a solution to the shortage of organ donors, and finds out whether the universe really is like a computer or if the flow of time is a mere illusion.</p>";
