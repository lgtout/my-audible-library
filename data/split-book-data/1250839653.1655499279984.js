window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The first book of its kind, a collection bringing together leading Black scholars and experts for a policy-oriented approach to the fight for racial justice in America.</b></p> <p>From ongoing reports of police brutality to the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on Black Americans, the year 2020 brought a renewed awareness to the deep-rootedness of racism and white supremacy in every facet of American life. As people have looked both inward and to their communities to understand the impact of systemic oppression, they have turned in droves to books for guidance in working toward a more just and equitable world. Until now, however, there has yet to be a book published for a general audience from the perspective of Black scholars and experts proposing ideas from a policy-oriented standpoint.</p> <p><i>The Black Agenda: Bold Solutions for a Broken System</i> features Black voices across economics, education, health, climate, and technology, speaking to the question \"What's next?\" as it pertains to centering Black people in policy matters in our country. Essayists including Dr. Sandy Darity, Dr. Hedwig Lee, Mary Heglar, and Janelle Jones present groundbreaking ideas ranging from Black maternal and infant health to reparations to AI bias to inclusive economic policy, with the potential to uplift and heal not only Black America, but the entire country.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press</b></p>";
