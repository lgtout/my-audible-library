window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A brilliant new theory of how and why some nations recover from trauma and others don't, by the author of the landmark best sellers <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> and <i>Collapse</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his earlier best sellers <i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i> and <i>Collapse</i>, Jared Diamond transformed our understanding of what makes civilizations rise and fall. Now, in the final audiobook in this monumental trilogy, he reveals how successful nations recover from crisis through selective change - a coping mechanism more commonly associated with personal trauma.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a dazzling comparative study, Diamond shows us how seven countries have survived defining upheavals in the recent past - from US Commodore Perry's arrival in Japan to the Soviet invasion of Finland to Pinochet's regime in Chile - through a process of painful self-appraisal and adaptation, and he identifies patterns in the way that these distinct nations recovered from calamity. Looking ahead to the future, he investigates whether the US and the world are squandering their natural advantages on a path toward political conflict and decline. Or can we still learn from the lessons of the past?&nbsp;</p> <p>Adding a psychological dimension to the awe-inspiring grasp of history, geography, economics, and anthropology that marks all Diamond's work, <i>Upheaval </i>reveals how both nations and individuals can become more resilient. The result is an audiobook that is epic, urgent, and groundbreaking.</p>";
