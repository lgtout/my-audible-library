window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This essential, pause-resister narrative on the history of drone warfare by the acclaimed author of <i>Rumsfeld</i> explores how this practice emerged, who made it happen, and the real consequences of targeted killing. </p> <p>Assassination by drone is a subject of deep and enduring fascination, yet few understand how and why it has become our principal way of waging war. <i>Kill Chain</i> uncovers the real and extraordinary story of drone warfare - its origins in long-buried secret programs, the breakthroughs that made drone operations possible, and the ways in which the technology works and, despite official claims, does not work. </p> <p>Taking the listener inside the well-guarded world of national security, the audiobook reveals the powerful interests - military, CIA, and corporate - that have led the drive to kill individuals by remote control. Most importantly of all, the book describes what has really happened when the theories underpinning the strategy - and the multibillion-dollar contracts they spawn - have been put to the test. </p> <p>Drawing on sources deep within the military and intelligence establishments, Andrew Cockburn's <i>Kill Chain</i> unveils the true effects, as demonstrated by bloody experience, of assassination warfare - a revelation that listeners will find surprising and shocking.</p>";
