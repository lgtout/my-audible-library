window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Global warming is perhaps the most dramatic example of what Timothy Morton calls \"hyperobjects\" - entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place. In this book, Morton explains what hyperobjects are and their impact on how we think, how we coexist with one another and with nonhumans, and how we experience our politics, ethics, and art. </p> <p>Moving fluidly between philosophy, science, literature, visual and conceptual art, and popular culture, the book argues that hyperobjects show that the end of the world has already occurred in the sense that concepts such as world, nature, and even environment are no longer a meaningful horizon against which human events take place. Instead of inhabiting a world, we find ourselves inside a number of hyperobjects, such as climate, nuclear weapons, evolution, or relativity. Such objects put unbearable strains on our normal ways of reasoning. </p> <p>Insisting that we have to reinvent how we think to even begin to comprehend the world we now live in, <i>Hyperobjects</i> takes the first steps, outlining a genuinely postmodern ecological approach to thought and action.</p>";
