window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dr. Gershon’s groundbreaking book fills the gap between what you need to know - and what your doctor has time to tell you.</p> <p>Dr. Michael Gershon has devoted his career to understanding the human bowel (the stomach, esophagus, small intestine, and colon). His 30 years of research have led to an extraordinary rediscovery: Nerve cells in the gut that act as a brain. This \"second brain\" can control our gut all by itself. Our two brains - the one in our head and the one in our bowel - must cooperate. If they do not, then there is chaos in the gut and misery in the head - everything from \"butterflies\" to cramps, from diarrhea to constipation. Dr. Gershon's work has led to radical new understandings about a wide range of gastrointestinal problems including gastroenteritis, nervous stomach, and irritable bowel syndrome. <i>The Second Brain</i> represents a quantum leap in medical knowledge and is already benefiting patients whose symptoms were previously dismissed as neurotic or \"it's all in your head\".&nbsp;</p>";
