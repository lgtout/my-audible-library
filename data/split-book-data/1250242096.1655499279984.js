window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Tim Campbell narrates this audiobook in a laid-back, nicely paced manner that makes Siegel's scary facts about the nation's problematic drinking water just a bit easier to swallow...This audiobook is important to anyone who drinks water.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile</i></b><b> magazine)</b></p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Seth M. Siegel shows how our drinking water got contaminated, what it may be doing to us, and what we must do to make it safe.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you thought America’s drinking water problems started and ended in Flint, Michigan, think again. From big cities and suburbs to the rural heartland, chemicals linked to cancer, heart disease, obesity, birth defects, and lowered IQ routinely spill from our taps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Many are to blame: the EPA, Congress, a bipartisan coalition of powerful governors and mayors, chemical companies, and drinking-water utilities - even NASA and the Pentagon. Meanwhile, the bottled-water industry has been fanning our fears about tap water, but bottled water is often no safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The tragedy is that existing technologies could launch a new age of clean, healthy, and safe tap water for only a few dollars a week per person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Scrupulously researched, <i>Troubled Water</i> is full of shocking stories about contaminated water found throughout the country and about the everyday heroes who have successfully forced changes in the quality and safety of our drinking water. And it concludes with what America must do to reverse decades of neglect and play-it-safe inaction by government at all levels in order to keep our most precious resource safe.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
