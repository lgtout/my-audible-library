window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Acclaimed historian and best-selling author Paul Johnson’s books have been translated into dozens of languages. In <i>Socrates: A Man for Our Times</i>, Johnson draws from little-known resources to construct a fascinating account of one of history’s greatest thinkers. Socrates transcended class limitations in Athens during the fifth century B.C. to develop ideas that still shape the way we think about the human body and soul, including the workings of the human mind. </p>";
