window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Karl Marx's <i>Capital </i>is one of the most important texts written in the modern era. Since 1867, when the first of its three volumes was published, it has had a profound effect on politics and economics in theory and practice throughout the world. But Marx wrote in the context of capitalism in the second half of the 19th century: his assumptions and analysis need to be updated in order to address the technological, economic, and industrial change that has followed <i>Capital</i>'s initial publication.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Marx, Capital, and the Madness of Economic Reason</i>, David Harvey not only provides a concise distillation of his famous course on <i>Capital</i>, but also makes the text relevant to the 21st century's continued processes of globalization. Harvey shows the work's continuing analytical power, doing so in the clearest and simplest terms but never compromising its depth and complexity.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Marx, Capital, and the Madness of Economic Reason</i> provides an accessible window into Harvey's unique approach to Marxism and takes listeners on a riveting roller-coaster ride through recent global history. It demonstrates how and why <i>Capital </i>remains a living, breathing document with an outsized influence on contemporary social thought.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
