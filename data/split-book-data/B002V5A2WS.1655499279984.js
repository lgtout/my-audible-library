window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One day, 14-year-old Sophie Amundsen comes home from school to find two notes in her mailbox, with one question on each: \"Who are you?\" and \"Where does the world come from?\"&nbsp;</p> <p>From that irresistible beginning, Sophie becomes obsessed with questions that take her far beyond what she knows of her Norwegian village. Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters addressed to another girl. Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning - but the truth turns out to be far more complicated than she could have imagined.</p> <p>A pause-resisting novel that is also an exploration of the great philosophical concepts of Western thought, <i>Sophie's World</i> has fired the imagination of listeners all over the world, having been translated into 45 languages and with over 20 million copies in print.&nbsp;</p>";
