window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The highly acclaimed, provocative <i>New York Times</i> best seller from the award-winning author of <i>Americanah</i>. In this personal, eloquently argued essay - adapted from the much-admired TEDx talk of the same name - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie offers listeners a unique definition of feminism for the 21st century, one rooted in inclusion and awareness. Drawing extensively on her own experiences and her deep understanding of the often masked realities of sexual politics, here is one remarkable author's exploration of what it means to be a woman now - and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.&nbsp;</p>";
