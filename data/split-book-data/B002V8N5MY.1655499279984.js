window.bookSummaryJSON = "Since September 11, 2001, Seymour M. Hersh has riveted readers, and outraged the Bush Administration, with his stories in <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine, including his breakthrough pieces on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Now, in <i>Chain of Command</i>, he brings together this reporting, along with new revelations, to answer the critical question of the last three years: how did America get from the clear morning when hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to a divisive and dirty war in Iraq? <p>Hersh established himself at the forefront of investigative journalism 35 years ago when he broke the news of the massacre in My Lai, Vietnam, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize. Ever since, he's challenged America's power elite by publishing the stories that others can't or won't tell.</p> <p>In <i>Chain of Command</i>, Hersh takes an unflinching look behind the public story of President Bush's \"war on terror\" and into the lies and obsessions that led America into Iraq. With an introduction by <i>The New Yorker</i>'s editor, David Remnick, <i>Chain of Command</i> is a devastating portrait of an administration blinded by ideology and of a President whose decisions have made the world a more dangerous place for America.</p>";
