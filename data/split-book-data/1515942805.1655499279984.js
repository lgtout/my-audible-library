window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For seven years, Paul Lockhart's <i>A Mathematician's Lament </i>enjoyed a samizdat-style popularity in the mathematics underground, before demand prompted its 2009 publication to even wider applause and debate. An impassioned critique of K-12 mathematics education, it outlined how we shortchange students by introducing them to math the wrong way. Here, Lockhart offers the positive side of the math education story by showing us how math should be done. <i>Measurement</i> offers a permanent solution to math phobia by introducing us to mathematics as an artful way of thinking and living.</p> <p>In conversational prose that conveys his passion for the subject, Lockhart makes mathematics accessible without oversimplifying. He makes no more attempt to hide the challenge of mathematics than he does to shield us from its beautiful intensity. Favoring plain English over jargon and formulas, he succeeds in making complex ideas about the mathematics of shape and motion intuitive and graspable. His elegant discussion of mathematical reasoning and themes in classical geometry offers proof of his conviction that mathematics illuminates art as much as science.</p> <p><i>Measurement</i> is an invitation to summon curiosity, courage, and creativity in order to experience firsthand the playful excitement of mathematical work.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
