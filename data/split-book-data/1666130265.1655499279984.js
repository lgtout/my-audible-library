window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A trenchant analysis of how public education is being destroyed in overt and deceptive ways - and how to fight back.</p> <p>If America's public schools don't survive the COVID-19 pandemic, it won't just be due to the virus. Opponents of public education have long sought to dismantle our system of free, universal, and taxpayer-funded schooling. But the present crisis has provided them with their best opportunity ever to realize that aim. Books like Jane Mayer's <i>Dark Money</i> and Nancy MacLean's <i>Democracy in Chains</i> sounded a clear warning about the influence that right-wing plutocrats increasingly exert over American politics. Now, <i>A Wolf at the Schoolhouse Door</i> takes their analyses a step further, addressing an urgent question: Why is the right so fixated on dismantling public education in the United States?</p> <p>Education historian Jack Schneider and journalist Jennifer Berkshire trace the war on public education to its origins, offering the deep backstory necessary to understand the threat presently posed to America's schools. The book also looks forward to imagine how current policy efforts will reshape the educational landscape and remake America's future. <i>A Wolf at the Schoolhouse Door</i> offers listeners a lively, accessible, yet scholarly view of a decades-long conservative cause: unmaking the system that serves more than 90 percent of students in the US.</p>";
