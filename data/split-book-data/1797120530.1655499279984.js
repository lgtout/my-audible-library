window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>National Best Seller </b></p> <p><b>“An optimistic view on why collective action is still possible - and how it can be realized.” (</b><b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>“As far as heroic characters go, I’m not sure you could do better than Katharine Hayhoe.” (</b><b><i>Scientific American</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>\"It’s not an exaggeration to say that </b><b><i>Saving Us</i></b><b> is one of the more important books about climate change to have been written.\" (</b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>United Nations Champion of the Earth, climate scientist, and evangelical Christian Katharine Hayhoe changes the debate on how we can save our future.</b></p> <p>Called “one of the nation's most effective communicators on climate change” by <i>The New York Times</i>, Katharine Hayhoe knows how to navigate all sides of the conversation on our changing planet. A Canadian climate scientist living in Texas, she negotiates distrust of data, indifference to imminent threats, and resistance to proposed solutions with ease. Over the past 15 years, Hayhoe has found that the most important thing we can do to address climate change is talk about it - and she wants to teach you how.</p> <p>In <i>Saving Us</i>, Hayhoe argues that when it comes to changing hearts and minds, facts are only one part of the equation. We need to find shared values in order to connect our unique identities to collective action. This is not another doomsday narrative about a planet on fire. It is a multilayered look at science, faith, and human psychology, from an icon in her field - recently named chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy.</p> <p>Drawing on interdisciplinary research and personal stories, Hayhoe shows that small conversations can have astonishing results. <i>Saving Us </i>leaves us with the tools to open a dialogue with your loved ones about how we all can play a role in pushing forward for change.</p>";
