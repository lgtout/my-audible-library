window.bookSummaryJSON = "Over a decade ago, Martin Seligman charted a new approach to living with \"flexible optimism\". Now, in his most stimulating and persuasive book to date, the best-selling author of <i>Learned Optimism</i> introduces the revolutionary, scientifically based idea of \"Positive Psychology\". Positive Psychology focuses on strengths rather than weaknesses, asserting that happiness is not the result of good genes or luck. Seligman teaches readers that happiness can be cultivated by identifying and using many of the strengths and traits that they already possess: kindness, originality, humor, optimism, and generosity. By frequently calling upon their \"signature strengths\" in all the crucial realms of life, listeners will not only develop natural buffers against misfortune and the experience of negative emotion, they will move their lives up to a new, more positive plane. <p> Drawing on groundbreaking psychological research, Seligman shows how Positive Psychology is shifting the profession's paradigm away from its narrow-minded focus on pathology, victimology, and mental illness to positive emotion, virtue and strength, and positive institutions. Our signature strengths can be nurtured throughout our lives, with benefits to our health, relationships, and careers.</p> <p> The life-changing lesson of <i>Authentic Happiness</i> is that by identifying the very best in ourselves, we can improve the world around us and achieve new and sustainable levels of authentic contentment, gratification, and meaning.</p>";
