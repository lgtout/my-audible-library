window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Cut through the noise around narcissism with the leading researcher in the field.</b></p> <p>“Narcissism” is truly one of the most important words our time ― ceaselessly discussed in the media, the subject of millions of online search queries, and at the centerpiece of serious social and political debates. But what does it really mean?</p> <p>In <i>The New Science of Narcissism</i>, Dr. W Keith Campbell pulls back the curtain on this frequently misused label, presenting the most recent psychological, personality, and social research into the phenomenon.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rather than pathologizing all behaviors associated with the label, Campbell reveals that not only does narcissism occur on a spectrum, but almost everyone exhibits narcissistic tendencies in their day-to-day behavior. Drawing from real-life incidents and case studies, <i>The New Science of Narcissism </i>offers tools, tips, and suggestions for softening toxically selfish behaviors both in yourself and others. Here, you will discover:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>An exploration of personality disorders connected with and adjacent to narcissism</li> <li>Why minor narcissistic tendencies are common in most people</li> <li>The foundational difference between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism&nbsp;</li> <li>Different psychological models of personality and how they interpret narcissistic behaviors</li> <li>The “recipe” of mental and emotional traits that combine into narcissism</li> <li>How to identify when you’re in a relationship with a narcissist and what you can do about it</li> <li>Why the 21st century has seen the rise of a “Great Fantasy Migration” into evermore insular subcultures</li> <li>The connection between narcissistic tendencies and leadership</li> <li>Why “the audience in your pocket” of social media has exacerbated culture-wide narcissistic tendencies</li> </ul> <p>Though narcissism looms large in our cultural consciousness, <i>The New Science of Narcissism</i> offers many different options for understanding and treating it. With Campbell’s straightforward and grounded guidance, you’ll not only discover the latest and best information on the condition, but also a hopeful view of its future.</p>";
