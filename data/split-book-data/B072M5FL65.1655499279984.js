Her careful examination of how we eviscerate the women who confound or threaten is crucial reading if we are ever to be better.” (Rebecca Traister, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>All the Single Ladies</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>From celebrity gossip expert and BuzzFeed culture writer Anne Helen Petersen comes an accessible, analytical look at how female celebrities are pushing the boundaries of what it means to be an \"acceptable\" woman. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>You know the type: the woman who won't shut up, who's too brazen, too opinionated - too much. She's the unruly woman, and she embodies one of the most provocative and powerful forms of womanhood today.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud</i>, Anne Helen Petersen uses the lens of \"unruliness\" to explore the ascension of powerhouses like Serena Williams, Hillary Clinton, Nicki Minaj, and Kim Kardashian, exploring why the public loves to love (and hate) these controversial figures. With its brisk, incisive analysis, <i>Too Fat, Too Slutty, Too Loud</i> is a conversation-starting book on what makes and breaks celebrity today.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Must-read list.” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)</p> <p>Named one of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>’s “Books You Won't Be Able to Put Down This Summer”.</p> <p>Selected as one of Amazon's “Best Books of the Month”.</p> <p>A <i>Refinery29 </i>editors' pick.</p>";
