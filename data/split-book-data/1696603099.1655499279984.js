window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Questions on the origins and meaning of dreams are as old as humankind and as confounding and exciting today as when 19th-century scientists first attempted to unravel them. Why do we dream? Do dreams hold psychological meaning, or are they merely the reflection of random brain activity? What purpose do dreams serve?</p> <p><i>When Brains Dream</i> addresses these core questions about dreams while illuminating the most up-to-date science in the field. Written by two world-renowned sleep and dream researchers, it debunks common myths while acknowledging the mysteries that persist around both the science and experience of dreaming.</p> <p>Antonio Zadra and Robert Stickgold bring together state-of-the-art neuroscientific ideas and findings to propose a new and innovative model of dream function called NEXTUP - Network Exploration to Understand Possibilities. By detailing this model's workings, they help listeners understand key features of several types of dreams, from prophetic dreams to nightmares and lucid dreams. <i>When Brains Dream</i> reveals recent discoveries about the sleeping brain and the many ways in which dreams are psychologically, and neurologically, meaningful experiences; explores a host of dream-related disorders; and explains how dreams can facilitate creativity and be a source of personal insight.</p>";
