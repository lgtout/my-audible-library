window.bookSummaryJSON = "In this lecture, Thomas Frank distills the central argument from his <i>New York Times</i> best seller, <i>What's the Matter With Kansas?</i>, which unravels the great political mystery of our day: why do so many Americans vote against their economic and social interests? In this special recorded lecture, Thomas Frank answers the riddle by examining his home state, Kansas, a place once famous for its radicalism that now ranks among the nation's most eager audiences for a backlash that he calls a \"derangement\", the popular revolt against a supposedly liberal establishment. <p> In his concise, reasoned approach, Frank charts how the \"great backlash mobilizes votes with explosive social issues\", marshalling cultural anger to achieve economic ends. As a result, conservatism, once a marker of class privilege and now the creed of millions of ordinary Americans, has become a \"working class movement that has done incalculable harm to the middle class\". </p>";
