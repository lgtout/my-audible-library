window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller </b></p> <p><b>James Baldwin grew disillusioned by the failure of the civil rights movement to force America to confront its lies about race. In our own moment, when that confrontation feels more urgently needed than ever, what can we learn from his struggle?</b></p> <p><b>Named One of the Ten Best Books of the Year by </b><b><i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><b> and One of the Best Books of the Year by the </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Time</i></b></p> <p><b>Shortlisted for the Goddard Riverside Stephan Russo Book Prize for Social Justice </b></p> <p><b>\"A powerful study of how to bear witness in a moment when America is being called to do the same.\" (</b><b><i>Time</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>We live, according to Eddie S. Glaude, Jr., in a moment when the struggles of Black Lives Matter and the attempt to achieve a new America have been challenged by the election of Donald Trump, a president whose victory represents yet another failure of America to face the lies it tells itself about race. From Charlottesville to the policies of child separation at the border, his administration turned its back on the promise of Obama’s presidency and refused to embrace a vision of the country shorn of the insidious belief that white people matter more than others.</p> <p>We have been here before: For James Baldwin, these <i>after times</i> came in the wake of the civil rights movement, when a similar attempt to compel a national confrontation with the truth was answered with the murders of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. In these years, spanning from the publication of <i>The Fire Next Time</i> in 1963 to that of <i>No Name in the Street</i> in 1972, Baldwin transformed into a more overtly political writer, a change that came at great professional and personal cost. But from that journey, Baldwin emerged with a sense of renewed purpose about the necessity of pushing forward in the face of disillusionment and despair.</p> <p>In the story of Baldwin’s crucible, Glaude suggests, we can find hope and guidance through our own after times, this Trumpian era of shattered promises and white retrenchment. Mixing biography - drawn partially from newly uncovered interviews - with history, memoir, and trenchant analysis of our current moment, <i>Begin Again</i> is Glaude’s endeavor, following Baldwin, to bear witness to the difficult truth of race in America today. It is at once a searing exploration that lays bare the tangled web of race, trauma, and memory, and a powerful interrogation of what we all must ask of ourselves in order to call forth a new America.</p>";
