window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most of us have different aspects, \"parts\", or \"ego states\" of ourselves - the silly and imaginative five-year-old part, for example, or the depressed, anxious, or angry adolescent - which manifest as particular moods, behaviors, and reactions depending on the demands of our external and internal environments. \"Ego state therapy\" refers to a powerful, flexible therapy that helps clients integrate and reconcile these distinct aspects of themselves.</p> <p>This audiobook offers a grab bag of ego state interventions - simple, practical techniques for a range of client issues - that any therapist can incorporate in his or her practice. In her characteristic wise, compassionate, and user-friendly writing style, Robin Shapiro explains what ego states are, how to access them in clients, and how to use them for a variety of treatment issues. After covering foundational interventions for accessing positive adult states, creating internal caregivers, and working with infant and child states in Part I: Getting Started with Ego State Work, Shapiro walks listeners step-by-step through a variety of specific interventions for specific problems, each ready for immediate application with clients. Part II: Problem-Specific Interventions includes chapters devoted to working with trauma, relationship challenges, personality disorders, suicidal ideation, and more.</p>";
