window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Now in audio - a fascinating work of popular science from a world-renowned expert on mosquitoes and a prize-winning reporter. </b></p> <p>In this lively and comprehensive portrait of the mosquito, its role in history, and its threat to mankind, Spielman and D'Antonio take a mosquito's-eye view of nature and man. They show us how mosquitoes breed, live, mate, and die and introduce us to their enemies, both natural and man-made. The authors present tragic and often grotesque examples of how the mosquito has insinuated itself into human history, from the malaria that devastated invaders of ancient Rome to the current widespread West Nile fever panic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Filled with little-known facts and remarkable anecdotes that bring this tiny being into larger focus, <i>Mosquito </i>offers fascinating, alarming, and convincing evidence that the sooner we get to know this pesky insect, the better off we'll be.</p>";
