window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.\" (Marcus Aurelius)</b></p> <p> We are stuck, stymied, frustrated. But it needn't be this way. There is a formula for success that's been followed by the icons of history - from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs - a formula that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. Faced with impossible situations, they found the astounding triumphs we all seek.</p> <p> These men and women were not exceptionally brilliant, lucky, or gifted. Their success came from timeless philosophical principles laid down by a Roman emperor who struggled to articulate a method for excellence in any and all situations.</p> <p> This book reveals that formula for the first time - and shows us how we can turn our own adversity into advantage.</p>";
