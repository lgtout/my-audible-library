window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Why do some people break through and make an impact while others get stuck going through the motions?</b></p> <p>In every organization there are Impact Players - those indispensable colleagues who can be counted on in critical situations and who consistently receive high-profile assignments and new opportunities.&nbsp;Whether they are on center stage or behind the scenes, managers know who these top players are, understand their worth, and want more of them on their team.&nbsp;While their impact is obvious, it’s not always clear what actually makes these professionals different from their peers.</p> <p>In <i>Impact Players</i>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and researcher Liz Wiseman reveals the secrets of these stellar professionals who play the game at a higher level.&nbsp;Drawing on insights from leaders at top companies, Wiseman explains what the most influential players are doing differently, how small and seemingly insignificant differences in how we think and act can make an enormous impact, and why - with a little coaching - this mindset is available to everyone who wants to contribute at their highest level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on a study of 170 top contributors, Wiseman identifies the mindsets that prevent otherwise smart, capable people from contributing to their full potential and the five practices that differentiate Impact Players:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>While others do their job, Impact Players figure out the real job to be done.&nbsp;</li> <li>While others wait for direction, Impact Players step up and lead.</li> <li>While others escalate problems, Impact Players move things across the finish line.</li> <li>While others attempt to minimize change, Impact Players are learning and adapting to change.&nbsp;</li> <li>While others add to the load, the Impact Players make heavy demands feel lighter.</li> </ul> <p>Wiseman makes clear that these practices - and the right mindset - can help any employee contribute at their fullest and shows leaders how they can raise the level of play for everyone on the team.&nbsp;<i>Impact Players</i> is your playbook for the new workplace.</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.&nbsp;</p>";
