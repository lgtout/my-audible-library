window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is the value of a college degree?&nbsp;</p> <p>The four-year college experience is as American as apple pie. So is the belief that higher education offers a ticket to a better life. But with student-loan debt surpassing the $1 trillion mark and unemployment of college graduates at historic highs, people are beginning to question that value.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>College (Un)Bound,</i> Jeffrey J. Selingo, editor at large of the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education,</i> argues that Americaâ€™s higher education system is broken. The great credentials race has turned universities into big businesses and fostered an environment where middle-tier colleges can command elite university-level tuitions while concealing staggeringly low graduation rates and churning out students with few of the skills needed for a rapidly evolving job market.&nbsp;</p> <p>Selingo not only turns a critical eye on the current state of higher education but also predicts how technology will transform it for the better. Free massive online open courses (MOOCs) and hybrid classes, adaptive learning software, and the unbundling of traditional degree credits will increase access to high-quality education regardless of budget or location and tailor lesson plans to individual needs. One thing is certain: the class of 2020 will have a radically different college experience than their parents had.&nbsp;</p> <p>Incisive, urgent, and controversial, <i>College (Un)bound</i> is a must-listen for prospective students, parents, and anyone concerned with the future of American higher education.</p>";
