window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A profound and deeply personal collection of essays by renowned psychologist Carl Rogers.</b></p> <p>The late Carl Rogers, founder of the humanistic psychology movement and father of client-centered therapy, based his life's work on his fundamental belief in the human potential for growth. <i>A Way of Being</i> was written in the early 1980s, near the end of Carl Rogers's career, and serves as a coda to his classic<i> On Becoming a Person</i>. More philosophical than his earlier writings, it traces his professional and personal development and ends with a prophetic call for a more humane future.</p>";
