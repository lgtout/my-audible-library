window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A humorous yet practical five-step guide to ridding ourselves - and our companies - of the bureaucratic bottlenecks and red tape that plague every office.</b></p> <p>You try to reserve a conference room for a crucial client meeting via your company’s new-and-improved computer service, only to find that every conference room is booked - seemingly forever.&nbsp;Your weekly conference call is hijacked by video screens freezing, cords not working, and employees dropping in and out. You then sit through an endless PowerPoint presentation that everyone claims they’ve read, no one has, and that could have been summarized in one page.</p> <p>What has happened to common sense? And how can we get it back? Companies, it seems, have become so entangled in their own internal issues, and further beset by reams of invisible red tape, that they’ve lost sight of their core purpose. Inevitably, they pay the price.</p> <p>Best-selling author Martin Lindstrom combines numerous real‑life examples of corporate common sense gone wrong with his own ingenious plan for restoring logic - and sanity - to the companies and people most in need.&nbsp;A must-hear for today’s executives, managers, and office workers, <i>The Ministry of Common Sense</i> is funny, entertaining, and immensely practical.</p> <p>Narrated by Robert Fass.&nbsp;Two-time winner of the prestigious Audie Award as well as numerous&nbsp;<i>AudioFile</i>&nbsp;Earphones Awards, veteran actor Robert&nbsp;Fass&nbsp;has narrated more than 200 unabridged audiobooks by modern and classic fiction writers such as Ray Bradbury, John Steinbeck, Saul Bellow, T.S. Eliot, Joyce Carol Oates, Carlos Fuentes, Jeffrey Deaver, and Lee Child, as well as best-selling and prize-winning nonfiction works in history, politics, health, journalism, philosophy, business, and memoir.</p>";
