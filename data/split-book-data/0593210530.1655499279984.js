window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“This book is a breakthrough. It’s beautifully written, perfectly timed and heralds a new way forward. I’m buying a dozen copies to share with friends and colleagues.” (Seth Godin, Founder of altMBA and author of </b><b><i>The Practice</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>If you let go of hierarchy, chaos will reign...or so many leaders believe.</b></p> <p><b>But when leaders find the courage to distribute rather than hoard power, creativity multiplies, trust deepens, and inclusivity&nbsp;expands...and a new kind of order emerges.</b></p> <p>A few rare leaders have learned to embrace a new organizational shape and mindset: Constellations. Organizations designed as constellations are dynamic and flexible&nbsp;networks of distinct yet interwoven individuals. Each member of the&nbsp;team feels like a singular star and is also connected to others to&nbsp;form something greater. That is how Visa reimagined how we pay for&nbsp;things, how Wikipedia beat the richest company in the world and how&nbsp;Barack Obama and his grassroots team revolutionized political&nbsp;campaigning. These leaders did what most leaders dread - they gave&nbsp;away power.</p> <p>Barzun brilliantly layers lessons across history and industries with his own experiences as an internet entrepreneur, political organizer, and US ambassador to the&nbsp;United Kingdom and Sweden. <i>The Power of Giving Away Power</i> shows how the Constellation mindset shines in some of the most impactful organizations and innovations the world has ever known. And it encourages us all to recognize, as Barzun&nbsp;writes, \"the power we can create by seeing the power in others\" - and&nbsp;making the leap to lead. Together.</p>";
