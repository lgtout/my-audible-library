window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This is an audiobook about </b><b><i>truth</i></b><b> - and all the ways we try to avoid it - from the best-selling author of </b><b><i>Humans: A Brief History of How We F--ked It All Up</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>We live in a “post-truth” world, we’re told. But was there ever <i>really</i> a golden age of truth-telling? Or have people been lying, fibbing, and just plain bullsh*tting since the beginning of time?&nbsp;</p> <p>Tom Phillips, editor of a leading independent fact-checking organization, deals with this question every day. In <i>Truth</i>, he tells the story of how we humans have spent history lying to each other - and ourselves - about everything from business to politics to plain old geography. Along the way, he chronicles the world’s oldest customer service complaint, the Great Moon Hoax of 1835, and the surprisingly dishonest career of Benjamin Franklin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sharp, witty, and with a clear-eyed view of humanity’s checkered past, <i>Truth</i> reveals why people lie - and how we can cut through the bullsh*t.</p>";
