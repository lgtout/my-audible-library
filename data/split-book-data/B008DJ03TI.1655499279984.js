window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>How to rewire your brain to improve virtually every aspect of your life - based on the latest research in neuroscience and psychology on neuroplasticity and evidence-based practices. </i></p> <p>Not long ago, it was thought that the brain you were born with was the brain you would die with, and that the brain cells you had at birth were the most you would ever possess. Your brain was thought to be hardwired to function in predetermined ways. It turns out that's not true. Your brain is not hardwired; it's \"softwired\" by experience. This book shows you how you can rewire parts of the brain to feel more positive about your life, remain calm during stressful times, and improve your social relationships. </p> <p>Written by a leader in the field of Brain-Based Therapy, it teaches you how to activate the parts of your brain that have been underactivated and calm down those areas that have been hyperactivated, so that you feel positive about your life and remain calm during stressful times. You will also learn to improve your memory, boost your mood, have better relationships, and get a good night's sleep. </p> <p><i>Rewire Your Brain</i> reveals how cutting-edge developments in neuroscience and evidence-based practices can be used to improve your everyday life. Explaining exciting new developments in neuroscience and their applications to daily living, this audiobook will guide you through the process of changing your brain so you can change your life and be free of self-imposed limitations. </p> <p> Dr. Arden is a leader in integrating the new developments in neuroscience with psychotherapy and director of training in mental health for Kaiser Permanente for the Northern California Region. Other titles by Dr. Arden include <i>Brain-Based Therapy - Adult</i>, <i>Brain-Based Therapy - Child</i>, <i>Improving Your Memory for Dummies</i> and <i>Heal Your Anxiety Workbook</i>. </p>";
