window.bookSummaryJSON = "Within your own heart is a limitless source of supreme energy, the energy of love. No other force in the universe compares to it. The world's great spiritual traditions, both past and present, agree on this simple principle. Can love be harnessed and applied to others, used as a \"tool\" for changing lives? <i>Lovingkindness Meditation</i> teaches a traditional practice for cultivating love, and applying it as a life-changing force. Dating back 2,600 years, the practice of metta (an ancient Buddhist term meaning \"lovingkindness\") is a timeless method for unlocking your heart's immense healing resources.";
