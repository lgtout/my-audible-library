window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Work with data like a pro using this guide that breaks down how to organize, apply, and most importantly, understand what you are analyzing in order to become a true data ninja. </b></p> <p>From the stock market to genomics laboratories, census figures to marketing email blasts, we are awash with data. But as anyone who has ever opened up a spreadsheet packed with seemingly infinite lines of data knows, numbers aren't enough: we need to know how to make those numbers talk. In <i>The Model Thinker</i>, social scientist Scott E. Page shows us the mathematical, statistical, and computational models - from linear regression to random walks and far beyond - that can turn anyone into a genius. At the core of the book is Page's \"many-model paradigm\", which shows the listener how to apply multiple models to organize the data, leading to wiser choices, more accurate predictions, and more robust designs. <i>The Model Thinker </i>provides a toolkit for business people, students, scientists, pollsters, and bloggers to make them better, clearer thinkers, able to leverage data and information to their advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
