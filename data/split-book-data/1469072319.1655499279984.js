window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Myth of Capitalism</i> tells the story of how America has gone from an open, competitive marketplace to an economy where a few very powerful companies dominate key industries that affect our daily lives. Digital monopolies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon act as gatekeepers to the digital world. Amazon is capturing almost all online shopping dollars. We have the illusion of choice, but for most critical decisions, we have only one or two companies, when it comes to high speed internet, health insurance, medical care, mortgage title insurance, social networks, internet searches, or even consumer goods like toothpaste. Every day, the average American transfers a little of their paycheck to monopolists and oligopolists.&nbsp;</p> <p>The solution is vigorous anti-trust enforcement to return America to a period where competition created higher economic growth, more jobs, higher wages, and a level playing field for all. <i>The Myth of Capitalism</i> is the story of industrial concentration, but it matters to everyone, because the stakes could not be higher. It tackles the big questions of: why the US is becoming a more unequal society, why economic growth is anemic despite trillions of dollars of federal debt and money printing, why the number of start-ups has declined, and why workers are losing out.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
