window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Portrait of a Lady</i> tells the compelling and ultimately tragic tale of a beautiful young American woman's encounter with European sophistication. Set principally in England and Italy, the story follows Isabel Archer's fortunes as a variety of admirers vie for her hand. Her choice will be crucial, and she is not wanting for advice, whether from the generous-spirited Ralph Touchett or the charming Madame Merle. </p> <p><i>The Portrait of a Lady</i> was an immediate success upon publication; it remains the most popular of James' longer works and is generally regarded as the masterpiece of his early period. </p>";
