window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The definitive overview of this transformative breathwork.</b></p> <p>In this long awaited book, Stanislav Grof and Christina Grof describe their groundbreaking new form of self-exploration and psychotherapy: Holotropic Breathwork.&nbsp;</p> <p>Holotropic means \"moving toward wholeness,\" from the Greek holos (whole) and trepein (moving in the direction of). The breathwork utilizes the remarkable healing and transformative potential of non-ordinary states of consciousness. These states engender a rich array of experiences with unique healing potential - reliving childhood memories, infancy, birth and prenatal life, and elements from the historical and archetypal realms of the collective unconscious.&nbsp;</p> <p>Induced by very simple means - a combination of accelerated breathing, evocative music, and bodywork in a safe and supportive setting - Holotropic Breathwork integrates the insights from modern consciousness research, depth psychology, transpersonal psychology, anthropology, Eastern spiritual practices, and mystical traditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Grofs' work with holotropic states of consciousness has introduced revolutionary changes to psychiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy. Written in a clear, easily understandable style, this indispensable book summarizes their remarkable insights.</p>";
