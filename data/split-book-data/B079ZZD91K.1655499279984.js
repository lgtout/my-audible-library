A philosophical treatise, the book was first published in Germany in 1894 after being banned in his home country of Russia. It is the culmination of 30 years of Tolstoy's thinking and lays out a new organization for society based on a literal Christian interpretation. <i>The Kingdom of God Is Within You</i> is a key text for Tolstoyan nonviolent resistance and Christian anarchist movements.</p>";
