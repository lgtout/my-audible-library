window.bookSummaryJSON = "American Empire is at its apex. We are the sole superpower, with no potential challenger for a generation. We can reach any point on the globe with our cruise missiles and smart bombs, and our culture penetrates every nook and cranny of the global village. Yet our beloved America is now reviled abroad, dictated to by arrogant judges at home, overrun by special interests, and buried beneath a mountain of debt. <p> <i>Where the Right Went Wrong</i> chronicles how the Bush administration and Beltway conservatives have abandoned their principles, and how a tiny cabal hijacked U.S. foreign policy and may have ignited a \"war of civilizations\" with the Islamic world that will leave America mired down in Middle East wars for years to come.</p> <p> At the same time, these Republicans have sacrificed the American worker on the altar of free trade and discarded the beliefs of Taft, Goldwater, and Reagan to become a party of big government that sells its soul to the highest bidder.</p>";
