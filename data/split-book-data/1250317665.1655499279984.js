window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"[Oliver Wyman's] skillful, nuanced performance is enough to keep listeners from tossing their earbuds aside in despair.... This isn't easy listening, but it's essential for anyone concerned about humanity's future.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>2019 </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><b> Best Books of the Year</b></p> <p><b>This program includes a foreword read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>Thirty years ago, Bill McKibben offered one of the earliest warnings about climate change. Now, he broadens the warning: The entire human game, he suggests, has begun to play itself out.</b></p> <p>Bill McKibben’s groundbreaking book <i>The End of Nature </i>- issued in dozens of languages and long regarded as a classic - was the first book to alert us to global warming. But the danger is broader than that: Even as climate change shrinks the space where our civilization can exist, new technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics threaten to bleach away the variety of human experience.</p> <p><i>Falter </i>tells the story of these converging trends and of the ideological fervor that keeps us from bringing them under control. And then, drawing on McKibben’s experience in building 350.org, the first truly global citizens movement to combat climate change, it offers some possible ways out of the trap. We’re at a bleak moment in human history - and we’ll either confront that bleakness or watch the civilization our forebears built slip away.</p> <p><i>Falter</i> is a powerful and sobering call to arms to save not only our planet, but also our humanity.</p>";
