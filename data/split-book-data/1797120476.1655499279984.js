window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An NPR Best Book of 2021</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>From acclaimed </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> reporter Josh Mitchell, the “devastating account” (</b><b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><b>) of student debt in America.</b></p> <p>In 1981, a new executive at Sallie Mae took home the company’s financial documents to review. “You’ve got to be shitting me,” he later told the company’s CEO. “This place is a gold mine.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the next four decades, the student loan industry that Sallie Mae and Congress created blew up into a crisis that would submerge a generation of Americans in $1.5 trillion in student debt. In <i>The Debt Trap</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Josh Mitchell tells the “vivid and compelling” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>) untold story of the scandals, scams, predatory actors, and government malpractice that have created the behemoth that one of its original architects called a “monster”.</p> <p>As he charts the “jaw-dropping” (Jeffrey Selingo, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Who Gets In and Why</i>) 70-year history of student debt in America, Mitchell never loses sight of the countless student victims ensnared by an exploitative system that depends on their debt. Mitchell also draws alarming parallels to the housing crisis in the late 2000s, showing the catastrophic consequences student debt has had on families and the nation’s future. Mitchell’s character-driven narrative is “necessary reading” (<i>The New York Times</i>) for anyone wanting to understand the central economic issue of our day.</p>";
