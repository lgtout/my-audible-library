window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why might some sex education programs result in more teen pregnancies? Why did reading that self-help book make you feel less happy? What's the best way to recover from trauma? Can we actually improve our lives by redirecting our thinking?</p> <p>We tell ourselves stories to make sense of the world. These stories ultimately determine if we will lead healthy, productive lives or get into trouble. Renowned psychologist Timothy Wilson proposes a radical new view: although these stories can be very hard to change, they can change - surprisingly quickly - if tweaked in the right way. He considers a broad range of problems, exposes failed attempts to solve them, and reframes them with new stories. Scientifically tested, his practical advice and simple techniques have been found to bring about real results including enhanced happiness, personal meaning, and social progress.</p>";
