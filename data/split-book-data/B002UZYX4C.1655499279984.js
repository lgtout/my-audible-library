window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Siddhartha</i> is Nobel Prize-winning author Hermann Hesse's most famous and influential work, a novel of self-exploration that will linger in your mind and spirit for a lifetime. <p>A young man, blessed with loving parents and a safe home in a world where want and neglect abound, leaves this haven in search of himself. He joins the Samanas, a band of wandering ascetics without possessions or earthly ties. His quest unfulfilled, he descends into a life of unbounded luxury and indulgence. Where is truth? Where will his soul find true ease? In denial? In decadence? Or in some truth far greater than himself, so simple, so close to him, yet so obvious that only clear eyes may see it?</p> <p><i>Siddhartha</i> reawakens questions most of us have long ceased asking ourselves and opens paths to spirituality many of us have never traveled.</p> <p>Translated by Joachim Neugroschel.</p>";
