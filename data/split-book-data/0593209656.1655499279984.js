window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>NUMBER ONE </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BEST SELLER&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>“I’ve read kind of all the books on this subject...and this is the one you want to read.” (Rachel Maddow)</b></p> <p><b>Before Ukraine, before impeachment: This is the never-before-told inside story of the high-stakes, four-year-long investigation into Donald Trump’s Russia ties - culminating in the Steele dossier, and sparking the Mueller report - from the founders of political opposition research company Fusion GPS.</b></p> <p>Fusion GPS was founded in 2010 by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, two former reporters at <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>who decided to abandon the struggling news business and use their reporting skills to conduct open-source investigations for businesses and law firms - and opposition research for political candidates. In the fall of 2015, they were hired to look into the finances of Donald Trump.</p> <p>What began as a march through a mind-boggling trove of lawsuits, bankruptcies, and sketchy overseas projects soon took a darker turn: The deeper Fusion dug, the more it began to notice names that Simpson and Fritsch had come across during their days covering Russian corruption - and the clearer it became that the focus of Fusion’s research going forward would be Trump’s entanglements with Russia.</p> <p>To help them make sense of what they were seeing, Simpson and Fritsch engaged the services of a former British intelligence agent and Russia expert named Christopher Steele. He would produce a series of memos - which collectively became known as the Steele dossier - that raised deeply alarming questions about the nature of Trump’s ties to a hostile foreign power. Those memos made their way to US intelligence agencies, and then to President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump. On January 10, 2017, the Steele dossier broke into public view, and the Trump-Russia story reached escape velocity. At the time, Fusion GPS was just a 10-person consulting firm tucked away above a Starbucks near Dupont Circle, but it would soon be thrust into the center of the biggest news story on the planet - a story that would lead to accusations of witch hunts, a relentless campaign of persecution by congressional Republicans, bizarre conspiracy theories, lawsuits by Russian oligarchs, and the Mueller report.</p> <p>In <i>Crime in Progress</i>, Simpson and Fritsch tell their story for the first time - a tale of the high-stakes pursuit of one of the biggest, most important stories of our time - no matter the costs.</p>";
