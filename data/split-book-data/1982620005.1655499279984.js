window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Stephen Batchelor's seminal work on humanity's struggle between good and evil.</p> <p>In the national best seller <i>Living with the Devil</i>, Batchelor traces the trajectory from the words of the Buddha and Christ, through the writings of Shantideva, Milton, and Pascal, to the poetry of Baudelaire, the fiction of Kafka, and the findings of modern physics and evolutionary biology to examine who we really are and to rest in the uncertainty that we may never know. Like his previous best seller, <i>Buddhism without Beliefs</i>, <i>Living with the Devil</i> is also an introduction to Buddhism that encourages listeners to nourish their \"buddha nature\" and make peace with the devils that haunt human life. He tells a poetic and provocative tale about living with life's contradictions that will challenge you to live your life as an existence imbued with purpose, freedom, and compassion-rather than habitual self-interest and fear.</p>";
