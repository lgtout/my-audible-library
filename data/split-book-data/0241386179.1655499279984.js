window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Penguin presents the audiobook of<i> Like a Thief</i> i<i>n Broad Daylight</i> by Slavoj Žižek, read by Jamie East.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent years, techno-scientific progress has started to utterly transform our world - changing it almost beyond recognition. In this extraordinary new audiobook, renowned philosopher Slavoj Zizek turns to look at the brave new world of Big Tech, revealing how, with each new wave of innovation, we find ourselves moving closer and closer to a bizarrely literal realisation of Marx's prediction that 'all that is solid melts into air'. With the automation of work, the virtualisation of money, the dissipation of class communities and the rise of immaterial, intellectual labour, the global capitalist edifice is beginning to crumble, more quickly than ever before - and it is now on the verge of vanishing entirely.&nbsp;</p> <p>But what will come next? Against a backdrop of constant sociotechnological upheaval, how could any kind of authentic change take place? In such a context, Zizek argues, there can be no great social triumph - because lasting revolution has already come into the scene, like a thief in broad daylight, stealing into sight right before our very eyes. What we must do now is wake up and see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Urgent as ever, <i>Like a Thief in Broad Daylight</i> illuminates the new dangers as well as the radical possibilities thrown up by today's technological and scientific advances and their electrifying implications for us all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
