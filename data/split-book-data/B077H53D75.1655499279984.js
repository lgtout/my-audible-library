window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Great by Choice</i> comes an authoritative, practical guide to individual performance - based on analysis from an exhaustive, groundbreaking study. </p> <p>Why do some people perform better at work than others? This deceptively simple question continues to confound professionals in all sectors of the workforce. Now, after a unique, five-year study of more than 5,000 managers and employees, Morten Hansen reveals the answers in his \"Seven Work Smarter Practices\" that can be applied by anyone looking to maximize their time and performance. </p> <p>Each of Hansen's seven practices is highlighted by inspiring stories from individuals in his comprehensive study. You'll meet a high school principal who engineered a dramatic turnaround of his failing high school; a rural Indian farmer determined to establish a better way of life for women in his village; and a sushi chef whose simple preparation has led to his restaurant (tucked away under a Tokyo subway station underpass) being awarded the maximum of three Michelin stars. Hansen also explains how the way Alfred Hitchcock filmed <i>Psycho</i> and the 1911 race to become the first explorer to reach the South Pole both illustrate the use of his seven practices (even before they were identified). </p> <p>Each chapter contains questions and key insights to allow you to assess your own performance and figure out your work strengths as well as your weaknesses. Once you understand your individual style, there are clear tips to assist your focus on a strategy to become a more productive worker. Extensive, accessible, and friendly, <i>Great at Work</i> will help you achieve more by working less, backed by unprecedented statistical analysis. </p>";
