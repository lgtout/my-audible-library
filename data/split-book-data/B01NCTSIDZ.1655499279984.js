window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A completely accessible, compelling and riveting account of pre-invasion Aboriginal agricultural systems. </p> <p><i>Dark Emu</i> argues for a reconsideration of the 'hunter-gatherer' tag for pre-colonial Aboriginal Australians and attempts to rebut the colonial myths that have worked to justify dispossession. Accomplished author Bruce Pascoe provides compelling evidence from the diaries of early explorers that suggests that systems of food production and land management have been blatantly understated in modern retellings of early Aboriginal history, and that a new look at Australia's past is required. </p>";
