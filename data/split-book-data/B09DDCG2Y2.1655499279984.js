window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Rise of the&nbsp;Robots&nbsp;</i></b><b>shows&nbsp;what&nbsp;happens&nbsp;as&nbsp;AI takes over&nbsp;our lives.</b></p> <p>If you have a smartphone, you have AI in your pocket. AI is impossible to avoid online. And it has already changed everything from how doctors diagnose disease to how you interact with friends or read the news. But in <i>Rule of the Robots</i>, Martin Ford argues that the true revolution is yet to come.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this sequel to his prescient <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Rise of the Robots</i>, Ford presents us with a striking vision of the very near future. He argues that AI is a uniquely powerful technology that is altering every dimension of human life, often for the better. For example, advanced science is being done by machines, solving devilish problems in molecular biology that humans could not, and AI can help us fight climate change or the next pandemic. It also has a capacity for profound harm. Deep fakes - AI-generated audio or video of events that never happened - are poised to cause havoc throughout society. AI empowers authoritarian regimes like China with unprecedented mechanisms for social control. And AI can be deeply biased, learning bigoted attitudes from us and perpetuating them.&nbsp;</p> <p>In short, this is not a technology to simply embrace or let others worry about. The machines are coming, and they wonâ€™t stop, and each of us needs to know what that means if we are to thrive in the 21st century. And <i>Rule of the Robots</i> is the essential guide to all of it: both AI and the future of our economy, our politics, our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
