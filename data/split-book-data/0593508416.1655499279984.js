window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A guide for parents to help children of all ages process the onslaught of unfiltered information in the digital age.</b></p> <p>Education is not solely about acquiring information and skills across subject areas, but also about understanding how and why we believe what we do. At a time when online media has created a virtual firehose of information and opinions, parents and teachers worry how students will interpret what they read and see. Amid the noise, it has become increasingly important to examine different perspectives with both curiosity and discernment. But how do parents teach these skills to their children?</p> <p>Drawing on more than 20 years’ experience homeschooling and developing curricula, Julie Bogart offers practical tools to help children at every stage of development to grow in their ability to explore the world around them, examine how their loyalties and biases affect their beliefs, and generate fresh insight rather than simply recycling what they’ve been taught. Full of accessible stories and activities for children of all ages, <i>Raising Critical Thinkers</i> helps parents to nurture passionate learners with thoughtful minds and empathetic hearts.</p> <p><b>This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF that contains exercises from the book.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
