window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Meticulously researched and engagingly written...a comprehensive indictment of the court’s rulings in areas ranging from campaign finance and voting rights to poverty law and criminal justice.” (</b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>A revelatory examination of the conservative direction of the Supreme Court over the last 50 years.</b><br> <br> In <i>Supreme Inequality</i>, best-selling author Adam Cohen surveys the most significant Supreme Court rulings since the Nixon era and exposes how, contrary to what Americans like to believe, the Supreme Court does little to protect the rights of the poor and disadvantaged; in fact, it has not been on their side for 50 years. Cohen proves beyond doubt that the modern Court has been one of the leading forces behind the nation’s soaring level of economic inequality, and that an institution revered as a source of fairness has been systematically making America less fair.&nbsp;</p> <p>A triumph of American legal, political, and social history, <i>Supreme Inequality </i>holds to account the highest court in the land and shows how much damage it has done to America’s ideals of equality, democracy, and justice for all.&nbsp;</p>";
