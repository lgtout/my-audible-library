window.bookSummaryJSON = "Lawyers. Accountants. Software Engineers. That's what Mom and Dad encouraged us to become. They were wrong. Gone is the age of \"left-brain\" dominance. The future belongs to a different kind of person with a different kind of mind: designers, inventors, teachers, storytellers - creative and emphatic \"right-brain\" thinkers whose abilities mark the fault line between who gets ahead and who doesn't. <p>Drawing on research from around the advanced world, Daniel Pink outlines six fundamentally human abilities that are essential for professional success and personal fulfillment - and reveals how to master them.</p> <p>From a laughter club in Bombay to an inner-city high school devoted to design, to a lesson on how to detect an insincere smile, <i>A Whole New Mind</i> takes listeners to a daring new place, and offers a provocative and urgent new way of thinking about a future that has already arrived.</p>";
