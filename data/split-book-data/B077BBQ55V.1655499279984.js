window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An extraordinary behind-the-scenes portrait of the court of Vladimir Putin, the oligarchs that surround it, and the many moods of modern Russia that reads like a \"real House of Cards\"(Lev Lurie).</p> <p><i>All the Kremlin's Men</i> is a gripping narrative of an accidental king and a court out of control. Based on an unprecedented series of interviews with Vladimir Putin's inner circle, this book presents a radically different view of power and politics in Russia. The image of Putin as a strongman is dissolved. In its place is a weary figurehead buffeted - if not controlled - by the men who at once advise and deceive him. The regional governors and bureaucratic leaders are immovable objects, far more powerful in their fiefdoms than the president himself. So are the gatekeepers - those officials who guard the pathways to power-on whom Putin depends as much as they rely on him. The tenuous edifice is filled with all of the intrigue and plotting of a Medici court, as enemies of the state are invented and wars begun to justify personal gains, internal rivalries, or one faction's biased advantage.&nbsp;</p> <p>A best seller in Russia, <i>All the Kremlin's Men</i> is a shocking revisionist portrait of the Putin era and a dazzling reconstruction of the machinations of courtiers running riot.</p>";
