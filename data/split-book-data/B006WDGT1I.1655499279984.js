window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</i> was Douglass' third autobiography. In it, he was able to go into greater detail about his life as a slave and his escape from slavery, as he and his family were no longer in any danger from the reception of his work. </p> <p>In this engrossing narrative, he recounts early years of abuse; his dramatic escape to the North and eventual freedom, abolitionist campaigns, and his crusade for full civil rights for former slaves. It is also the only of Douglass' autobiographies to discuss his life during and after the Civil War, including his encounters with American Presidents such as Lincoln, Grant, and Garfield.</p>";
