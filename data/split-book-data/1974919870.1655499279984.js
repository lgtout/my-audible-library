window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The year is 2393, and the world is almost unrecognizable. Clear warnings of climate catastrophe went ignored for decades, leading to soaring temperatures, rising sea levels, widespread drought, and - finally - the disaster now known as the Great Collapse of 2093, when the disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet led to mass migration and a complete reshuffling of the global order.&nbsp;</p> <p>Writing from the Second People's Republic of China on the 300th anniversary of the Great Collapse, a senior scholar presents a gripping and deeply disturbing account of how the children of the Enlightenment - the political and economic elites of the so-called advanced industrial societies - failed to act, bringing about the collapse of Western civilization.</p> <p>Dramatizing science in ways traditional nonfiction cannot, <i>The Collapse of Western Civilization </i>reasserts the importance of scientists and the work they do, providing a welcome moment of clarity amid the cacophony of climate-change literature.</p>";
