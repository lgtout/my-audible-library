window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Named one of the 10 best books of 2013 by Michiko Kakutani and the <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b> </p> <p>Alan S. Blinder - esteemed Princeton professor, <i>Wall Street Journal</i> columnist, and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board under Alan Greenspan - is one of our wisest and most clear-eyed economic thinkers. In <i>After the Music Stopped</i>, he delivers a masterful narrative of how the worst economic crisis in postwar American history happened, what the government did to fight it, and what we must do to recover from it. With bracing clarity, Blinder chronicles the perfect storm of events beginning in 2007, from the bursting of the housing bubble to the implosion of the bond bubble, and how events in the U.S. spread throughout the interconnected global economy. Truly comprehensive and eminently listenable, <i>After the Music Stopped</i> is the essential book about the financial crisis.</p>";
