window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How does science work? Does it tell us what the world is \"really\" like? What makes it different from other ways of understanding the universe? In <i>Theory and Reality</i>, Peter Godfrey-Smith addresses these questions by taking the listener on a grand tour of 100 years of debate about science. The result is a completely accessible introduction to the main themes of the philosophy of science. </p> <p>Intended for undergraduates and general audiences with no prior background in philosophy, <i>Theory and Reality</i> covers logical positivism; the problems of induction and confirmation; Karl Popper's theory of science; Thomas Kuhn and \"scientific revolutions\"; the views of Imre Lakatos, Larry Laudan, and Paul Feyerabend; and challenges to the field from sociology of science, feminism, and science studies. The book then looks in more detail at some specific problems and theories, including scientific realism, the theory-ladeness of observation, scientific explanation, and Bayesianism. </p> <p>Finally, Godfrey-Smith defends a form of philosophical naturalism as the best way to solve the main problems in the field. </p>";
