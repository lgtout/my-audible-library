window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The flood of information, unprecedented transparency, increasing interconnectedness - and our global interdependence - are dramatically reshaping today's world, the world of business, and our lives. We are in the Era of Behavior and the rules of the game have fundamentally changed. It is no longer what you do that matters most and sets you apart from others, but how you do what you do. </p> <p>\"Whats\" are commodities, easily duplicated or reverse-engineered. Sustainable advantage and enduring success for organizations and the people who work for them now lie in the realm of \"how\", the new frontier of conduct. </p> <p>For almost two decades, Dov Seidman's pioneering organization, LRN, has helped some of the world's most respected companies build \"do it right\" winning cultures and inspire principled performance throughout their organizations. Seidman's distinct vision of the world, business, and human endeavor has helped enable more than 15 million people doing business in more than 120 countries to out-behave the competition. </p> <p>In <i>HOW: Why HOW We Do Anything Means Everything</i>, Dov Seidman shares his unique approach with you. Now updated and expanded, <i>HOW</i> includes a new foreword from President Bill Clinton and a new preface from Dov Seidman on why <i>how</i> we behave, lead, govern, operate, consume, engender trust in our relationships, and relate to others matters more than ever and in ways it never has before. </p> <p>Through entertaining anecdotes, surprising case studies, cutting-edge research in a wide range of fields, and revealing interviews with a diverse group of leaders, business executives, experts, and everyday people on the front lines, this book explores how we think, how we behave, how we lead, and how we govern our institutions and ourselves to uncover the values-inspired \"hows\" of 21st-century success and significance. </p> <p>Divided into four comprehensive parts, this insightful book: </p> <ul> <li>Exposes the forces and factors that have fundamentally restructured the world in which organizations operate and their people conduct themselves, placing a new focus on their hows </li> <li>Provides frameworks to help you understand those hows and implement them in powerful and productive ways </li> <li>Helps you channel your actions and decisions in order to thrive uniquely within today's new realities </li> <li>Sheds light on the systems of how - the dynamics between people that shape organizational culture - and introduces a bold new vision for leading and winning through self-governance </li> </ul> <p>The qualities that many once thought of as \"soft\" - values, trust, and reputation - are now the hard currency of success and the ultimate drivers of efficiency, performance, innovation, and growth. </p> <p>With in-depth insights and practical advice, <i>HOW</i> will help you bring excellence and significance to your business endeavors - and your life - and refocus your efforts in powerful new ways. If you want to stand out, to thrive in our fast changing, hyperconnected, and hypertransparent world, listen to this book and discover <i>HOW.</i></p>";
