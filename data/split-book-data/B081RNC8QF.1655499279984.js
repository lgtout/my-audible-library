window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The world is increasingly unthinkable, a world of planetary disasters, emerging pandemics, and the looming threat of extinction. In this book, Eugene Thacker suggests that we look to the genre of horror as offering a way of thinking about the unthinkable world.&nbsp;</p> <p>To confront this idea is to confront the limit of our ability to understand the world in which we live - a central motif of the horror genre. <i>In the Dust of This Planet</i> explores these relationships between philosophy and horror.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Thacker's hands, philosophy is not academic logic-chopping; instead, it is the thought of the limit of all thought, especially as it dovetails into occultism, demonology, and mysticism. Likewise, Thacker takes horror to mean something beyond the focus on gore and scare tactics, but as the underappreciated genre of supernatural horror in fiction, film, comics, and music.</p> <p>\"Thacker's discourse on the intersection of horror and philosophy is utterly original and utterly captivating...\" (Thomas Ligotti, author of <i>The Conspiracy Against the Human Race</i>)</p>";
