window.bookSummaryJSON = "Jonathan Safran Foer spent much of his teenage and college years oscillating between omnivore and vegetarian. But on the brink of fatherhood - facing the prospect of having to make dietary choices on a child's behalf - his casual questioning took on an urgency. <p>His quest for answers ultimately required him to visit factory farms in the middle of the night, dissect the emotional ingredients of meals from his childhood, and probe some of his most primal instincts about right and wrong. </p> <p>Brilliantly synthesizing philosophy, literature, science, memoir, and his own detective work, <i>Eating Animals</i> explores the many fictions we use to justify our eating habits - from folklore to pop culture to family traditions and national myth - and how such tales can lull us into a brutal forgetting. Marked by Foer's profound moral ferocity and unvarying generosity, as well as the vibrant style and creativity that made his previous books, <i>Everything Is Illuminated</i> and <i>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</i>, widely loved, <i>Eating Animals</i> is a celebration and a reckoning, a story about the stories we've told - and the stories we now need to tell.</p>";
