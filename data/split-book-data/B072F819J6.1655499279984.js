Milton Mayer's book is a study of 10 Germans and their lives from 1933-45, based on interviews he conducted after the war when he lived in Germany. </p> <p>Mayer had a position as a research professor at the University of Frankfurt and lived in a nearby small Hessian town which he disguised with the name \"Kronenberg\". \"These ten men were not men of distinction,\" Mayer noted, but they had been members of the Nazi Party; Mayer wanted to discover what had made them Nazis. </p>";
