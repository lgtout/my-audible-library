window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In a radical reinterpretation of how the mind works, an eminent behavioral scientist reveals the illusion of mental depth.</b></p> <p>Psychologists and neuroscientists struggle with how best to interpret human motivation and decision making. The assumption is that below a mental \"surface\" of conscious awareness lies a deep and complex set of inner beliefs, values, and desires that govern our thoughts, ideas, and actions, and that to know this depth is to know ourselves.</p> <p>In this profoundly original book, behavioral scientist Nick Chater contends just the opposite: Rather than being the plaything of unconscious currents, the brain generates behaviors in the moment based entirely on our past experiences. Engaging the listener with eye-opening experiments, the author first demolishes our intuitive sense of how our mind works, then argues for a positive interpretation of the brain as a ceaseless and creative improviser.</p>";
