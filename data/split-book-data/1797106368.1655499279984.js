window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The instant </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller that reveals the collusion between Fox News and Donald Trump - with explosive new reporting covering the election and the January 6 riot.</b></p> <p>As the nation recovers from the Trump presidency, many questions remain: Why was the COVID-19 pandemic so grossly mishandled? How did we get so politically polarized? What caused White nationalist groups to come out of the shadows, and are they here to stay?</p> <p>The answers lie the twisted story of the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News. Through firsthand accounts from over 250 current and former Fox insiders, CNN anchor and chief media correspondent Brian Stelter unlocks the inner workings of Rupert Murdoch’s multibillion-dollar media empire. The confessions are shocking: “We don’t really believe all this stuff,” a producer says. “We just tell other people to believe it.”</p> <p>Stelter completes the story of the Trump years and looks toward the future of the network that made him. <i>Hoax </i>is a book for anyone who reads the news and wonders how we got here, and what happens next.</p>";
