window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Casper ter Kuile, a Harvard Divinity School fellow and cohost of the popular </b><b><i>Harry Potter and the Sacred Text</i></b><b> podcast, explores how we can nourish our souls by transforming common, everyday practices - yoga, reading, walking the dog - into sacred rituals that can heal our crisis of social isolation and struggle to find purpose - a message we need more than ever for our spiritual and emotional well-being in the age of COVID-19.</b></p> <p><b>\"After half a decade of research and hundreds of conversations with people around the country, I am convinced we are in the midst of a paradigm shift. That what used to hold us in community no longer works, and that the spiritual offerings of yesteryear no longer help us thrive.\" (Casper ter Kuile)</b></p> <p>What do Soul Cycle, gratitude journals, and tech breaks have in common? For ter Kuile, they offer rituals that create the foundation for our modern spiritual lives.</p> <p>We are in crisis today. Our modern technological society has left too many of us - no matter our ages - feeling isolated and bereft of purpose. Previous frameworks for building community and finding meaning no longer support us. Yet, ter Kuile reveals a hopeful new message: We might not be religious, but that doesn’t mean we are any less spiritual.</p> <p>Instead, we are in the midst of a paradigm shift in which we seek belonging and meaning in secular practices. Today, we find connection in:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>CrossFit and SoulCycle, which offer a sense of belonging rooted in accountability and support much like church groups</li> <li><i>Harry Potter</i> and other beloved books that offer universal lessons</li> <li>Gratitude journals, which have replaced traditional prayer</li> <li>Tech breaks, which provide mindful moments of calm</li> </ul> <p>In <i>The Power of Ritual</i>, ter Kuile invites us to deepen these ordinary practices as intentional rituals that nurture connection and&nbsp; well-being. With wisdom and endearing wit, ter Kuile’s call for ritual is ultimately a call to heal our loss of connection to ourselves, to others, and to our spiritual identities.</p> <p><i>The Power of Ritual</i> reminds us that what we already do every day matters - and has the potential to become a powerful experience of reflection, sanctuary, and meaning.</p>";
