But beneath the veneer of \"having it all\", she is bored - and consumed by an insatiable need for sex, whatever the cost. Struggling to contain the twin forces of compulsion and desire, she begins to orchestrate her life around her one-night stands and extramarital affairs, arriving late to work and lying to her husband about where she’s been, until she becomes ensnared in a trap of her own making.&nbsp;</p> <p>An erotic and daring story - with electrically clear writing - <i>Adèle</i> will captivate listeners with its exploration of addiction, sexuality, and one woman’s quest to feel alive.</p>";
