window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Beau Lotto, the world-renowned neuroscientist, entrepreneur, and two-time TED speaker, takes us on a tour of how we perceive the world - and how disrupting it leads us to create and innovate. </p> <p>Perception is the foundation of human experience, but few of us understand why we see what we do, much less how. By revealing the startling truths about the brain and its perceptions, Beau Lotto shows that the next big innovation is not a new technology: It is a new way of seeing. </p> <p>In his first major book, Lotto draws on over two decades of pioneering research to explain that our brain didn't evolve to see the world accurately. It can't! With clear and comprehensive explanations of the science behind how our perceptions operate, <i>Deviate</i> will revolutionize the way you see yourself, others, and the world. </p> <p>With this new understanding of how the brain functions, <i>Deviate</i> is not just an illuminating account of the neuroscience of thought, behavior, and creativity: It is a call to action, enlisting listeners in their own journey of self-discovery. </p>";
