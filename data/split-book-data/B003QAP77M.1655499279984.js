window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling author of <i>The Big Switch</i> returns with an explosive look at technology’s effect on the mind.</p> <p>“Is Google making us stupid?” When Nicholas Carr posed that question in an <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> cover story, he tapped into a well of anxiety about how the internet is changing us. He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the internet’s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply?</p> <p>Now, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration yet published of the internet’s intellectual and cultural consequences. Weaving insights from philosophy, neuroscience, and history into a rich narrative, <i>The Shallows</i> explains how the internet is rerouting our neural pathways, replacing the subtle mind of the book reader with the distracted mind of the screen watcher. A gripping story of human transformation played out against a backdrop of technological upheaval, <i>The Shallows</i> will forever alter the way we think about media and our minds.</p>";
