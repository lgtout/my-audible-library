window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This new edition of Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche's classic teaching on progressive stages of meditation on emptiness was updated in 2016 by Lama Shenpen Hookham.</p> <p><i>Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness</i> is a series of meditation practices on Emptiness, a particular aspect of the Buddha's teachings. The idea is that by beginning with one's first rather coarse commonsense understanding, one progresses through increasingly subtle and more refined stages until one arrives at complete and perfect understanding. Each stage in the process prepares the mind for the next in so far as each step is fully integrated into one's understanding through the meditation process.</p> <p>Concise but comprehensive, <i>Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness</i> lays out in a practical and systematic way the teachings of the Venerable Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, one of the most erudite scholars and accomplished yogis of the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism of our day. Khenpo Rinpoche is especially well-known for his breadth of vision and the clarity of his Dharma expositions, uniting prodigious scholarship with great compassion.</p> <p>Lama Shenpen Hookham, translator and arranger of <i>Progressive Stages of Meditation</i> on Emptiness, has been a student of Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche since the 1970s. A prolific writer, translator, and teacher, she is the founding lama of the Awakened Heart Sangha, a worldwide spiritual community based in the UK.</p>";
