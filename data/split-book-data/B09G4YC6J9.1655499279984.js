window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A riveting biography of Walter F. White, a little-known Black civil rights leader who passed for White in order to investigate racist murders, help put the NAACP on the map, and change the racial identity of America forever.</b></p> <p>Walter F. White led two lives: one as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance and the NAACP in the early 20th century; the other as a White newspaperman who covered lynching crimes in the Deep South at the blazing height of racial violence. Born mixed race and with very&nbsp;fair&nbsp;skin and straight hair, White was able to “pass” for White. He leveraged this ambiguity as a reporter, bringing to light the darkest crimes in America and helping to plant the seeds of the civil rights movement. White’s risky career led him to lead a double life. He was simultaneously a second-class citizen subject to Jim Crow laws at home and a widely respected professional with full access to the White world at work. His life was fraught with internal and external conflict - much like the story of race in America. Starting out as an obscure activist, White ultimately became Black America’s most prominent leader. A character study of White’s life and career with all these complexities has never been rendered, until now.</p> <p>By the award-winning, best-selling author of <i>The Accidental President</i>, <i>Dewey Defeats Truman</i>, and <i>The Arsenal of Democracy</i>, <i>White Lies</i> uncovers the life of a civil rights leader unlike any other.&nbsp;</p>";
