window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1982,&nbsp;Sister Helen Prejean became the spiritual advisor to Patrick Sonnier,&nbsp;the convicted killer of two teenagers who was sentenced to die in the electric chair of Louisiana’s Angola State Prison. In the months before Sonnier’s death,&nbsp;the Roman Catholic nun came to know a man who was as terrified as he had once been terrifying.&nbsp;She also&nbsp;came to know the families of the victims and the men whose job it was to execute - men who often harbored doubts about the rightness of what they were doing.</p> <p>Out of that dreadful intimacy comes a profoundly moving spiritual journey through our system of capital punishment.&nbsp;Here Sister Helen confronts&nbsp;both the plight of the condemned and the rage of the bereaved,&nbsp;the fears of a society shattered by violence and the Christian imperative of love.&nbsp;On its original publication in 1993,&nbsp;<i>Dead Man Walking</i>&nbsp;emerged as&nbsp;an unprecedented look at the human consequences of the death penalty.&nbsp;Now, some two decades later,&nbsp;this&nbsp;story - which has inspired a film, a stage play, an opera and a musical album - is more gut-wrenching than ever, stirring deep and life-changing reflection in all who encounter it.</p> <p><b>Read by the author, Helen Prejean</b></p> <p><b>Preface written by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and read by Dominic Hoffman</b></p> <p><b>Afterwords written and read by Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins</b></p>";
