As Morgan argues, we've gotten better at talking about mental health, but we still shy away from discussing periods, miscarriage, endometriosis, and menopause. That results in a lack of vital understanding for women, particularly as those processes are inextricably connected to our mental health; by exploring women's bodies in conjunction with our minds, Morgan urges for new thinking about our health.</p> <p>Examining the mythology of female hormones, the ways that culture shapes our perceptions of women's bodies, and the latest medical research,<i> Hysterical</i> skillfully paints a portrait of the modern landscape of women and health - and shows us how to navigate stigma and misinformation.</p>";
