window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When you drop a box of unwanted items off at the local thrift store, where do they go? Probably across the country - or even halfway across the world - to people and places eager to reuse what you don’t want.</b></p> <p>In <i>Secondhand</i>, Adam Minter delves into the vast, multibillion-dollar industry that resells used stuff around the world. He follows the trail of unwanted objects from the closets, garages, and storage units of Middle America to epic used-goods markets in Canada, Mexico, Japan, Ghana, India, Malaysia, and beyond. <i>Secondhand</i> takes us through the often painful and heartbreaking process of cleaning out a lifetime’s worth of possessions and shows that used stuff still has a place in a world that values the new and shiny - it entertains us, makes fortunes, fulfills needs, and transforms the way we live and work.</p>";
