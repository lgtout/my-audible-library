window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The pioneering originator of ACT teaches us the core principles and methods of this innovative, evidence-based model of life transformation.</b></p> <p>Have you ever tried to \"think” your way out of emotional turmoil - and ended up feeling even worse? Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) emerges from a remarkable insight: that when our normal problem-solving skills are applied to painful thoughts or feelings, suffering often increases.</p> <p>Dr. Steven C. Hayes, ACT's originator and codeveloper, has found this to be true in almost every area of life's struggles. \"Fortunately,\" he begins, \"we have discovered why this is, and we have developed ways of correcting it.\"</p> <p>For more than 30 years, ACT has been used effectively to treat not only mental and behavioral health problems such as anxiety and depression, but to help support workplace success, sports performance, weight loss, and social change. ACT works by helping us to accept and learn from our emotions, to think more freely and flexibly, and to find a liberating new perspective that allows us to take action based on what matters most to us.</p> <p>Here, you will join this pioneering researcher to learn firsthand about the essentials of ACT. If you're seeking to improve your life, these sessions offer an immersive way to understand this demonstrated path to greater happiness and well-being.</p> <p><b>Highlights:</b></p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Session one: \"Learning to Let Life Be Your Teacher\"</li> <li>Session two: \"Examining Your Sense of Self\"</li> <li>Session three: \"Opening Up to Letting Go\"</li> <li>Session four: \"Living Within Your Yes\"</li> <li>Session five: \"Coming into the Present Moment\"</li> <li>Session six: \"Identifying Values\"</li> <li>Session seven: \"Committed Action\"</li> <li>Session eight: \"Bringing It All Together\"&nbsp;</li> </ol>";
