window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Author Dax-Devlon Ross radiates the equanimity needed for listeners to absorb his healing perspectives. His performance is adroit and appealing, and has the added benefit of palpable commitment to his insights and engagement with his personal stories.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile</i></b> <b><i>Magazine</i></b><b>)</b><br> <br> <b>This program is read by the author.</b><br> <br> <b>In </b><b><i>Letters to My White Male Friends</i></b><b>, Dax-Devlon Ross speaks directly to the millions of middle-aged white men who are suddenly awakening to race and racism. </b><br> <br> White men are finally realizing that simply not being racist isn’t enough to end racism. These men want deeper insight not only into how racism has harmed Black people, but, for the first time, into how it has harmed <i>them</i>. They are beginning to see that racism warps us all.<i> Letters to My White Male Friends</i> promises to help men who have said they are committed to change and to develop the capacity to see, feel and sustain that commitment so they can help secure racial justice for us all.<br> <br> Ross helps listeners understand what it meant to be America’s first generation raised after the civil rights era. He explains how we were all educated with colorblind narratives and symbols that typically, albeit implicitly, privileged whiteness and denigrated Blackness. He provides the context and color of his own experiences in white schools so that white men can revisit moments in their lives where racism was in the room even when they didn’t see it enter. Ross shows how learning to see the harm that racism did to him, and forgiving himself, gave him the empathy to see the harm it does to white people as well. <br> <br> Ultimately, Ross offers white men direction so that they can take just action in their workplace, community, family, and, most importantly, in themselves, especially in the future when race is no longer in the spotlight.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press</b><br> <br> “A sweeping deep dive into decades of American social history and politics that is at once personal, compelling, and damning. A fiery, eloquent call to action for White men who want to be on the right side of history.” (<i>Kirkus, </i>starred review)</p>";
