window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A six-session training course for transforming your relationship with yourself. </p> <p>Why does it feel so natural to be compassionate and kind to those we care about - yet so hard to treat ourselves the same way? \"Our culture teaches us to use self-criticism for motivation and to build self-esteem by constantly measuring ourselves against everyone else,\" says Dr. Kristin Neff. \"We need to re-learn the essential skill of being genuinely nurturing and supportive toward ourselves.\" With <i>Self-Compassion Step by Step,</i> this groundbreaking researcher reveals the clinically proven power of self-kindness, with practical training for cultivating an enduring and unshakable sense of your fundamental human worthiness. </p> <p>Over the past decade, an overwhelming body of research has shown self-compassion to be a master key to good psychological and physical health. Whether you wish to reduce stress, develop healthy habits for exercise or diet, unlock your creativity, or even deal with serious conditions such as depression or addiction, a strong sense of self-compassion is an essential ingredient for success. Best of all, self-compassion is a skill that can be learned. Through six sessions of teaching, Dr. Neff offers guided meditations, experiential practices, and on-the-spot techniques to help you build a strong foundation of self-compassion in your daily life.</p> <p>\"We often become our own worst critic because we believe it's necessary to keep ourselves motivated,\" says Dr. Neff, \"but in fact the research shows that healthy self-compassion increases our inner drive, our resilience to setbacks, and our ability to excel at work and in every aspect of life.\" </p> <p>With <i>Self-Compassion Step by Step,</i> she presents a powerful training course that is both accessible and profoundly transformative - a practical approach for creating a life of greater happiness, fulfillment, and love.</p>";
