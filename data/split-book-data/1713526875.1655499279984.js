window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“One of the most provocative new books of the year, and, for me, mindblowing.” - <b>Michael Pollan</b>, author of <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i> and <i>How to Change Your Mind</i></p> <p>“Kripal makes many sympathetic points about the present spiritual state of America.... [He] continues to believe that spirituality and science should not contradict each other.” - <b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p> <p>“Kripal prompts us to reflect on our personal assumptions, as well as the shared assumptions that create and maintain our institutions.... [His] work will likely become more and more relevant to more and more areas of inquiry as the century unfolds. It may even open up a new space for Americans to reevaluate the personal and cultural narratives they have inherited, and to imagine alternative futures.” - <b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b></p> <p>A “flip,” writes Jeffrey J. Kripal, is “a reversal of perspective,” “a new real,” often born of an extreme, life-changing experience. <i>The Flip</i> is Kripal’s ambitious, visionary program for unifying the sciences and the humanities to expand our minds, open our hearts, and negotiate a peaceful resolution to the culture wars. Combining accounts of rationalists’ spiritual awakenings and consciousness explorations by philosophers, neuroscientists, and mystics within a framework of the history of science and religion, Kripal compellingly signals a path to mending our fractured world.</p>";
