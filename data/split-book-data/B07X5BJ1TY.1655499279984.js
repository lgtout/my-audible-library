window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Has science confirmed what the Buddha already knew?</b></p> <p>In this groundbreaking audiobook, neuropsychology professor Chris Niebauer explains how after decades of research on the brain, Western science may have inadvertently confirmed a fundamental tenet of Buddhism: <i>anatta</i>, or the doctrine of \"no self\".</p> <p>Niebauer shows how findings in neuropsychology suggest that our sense of self is actually an illusion created by the left side of the brain and that it exists in the same way a mirage in the middle of the desert exists: as a thought rather than a thing. This incredible thesis has significant and wide-ranging implications in psychology, philosophy, religion, and personal growth.</p> <p>Not content to merely detail how this radical new - yet ancient - perspective could change our view of the world and what it means to be human, Niebauer also offers a range of intriguing exercises at the end of each chapter that will allow you to experience this truth for yourself.</p> <p>Listen to this audiobook, and you will never view \"self-help\" the same way again!</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
