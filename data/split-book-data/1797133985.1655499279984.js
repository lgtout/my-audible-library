window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><b> Best Book of the Year</b></p> <p><b>A “provocative” (</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><b>) and compelling look at the powerful global forces that will cause billions of us to move geographically over the next decades, ushering in an era of radical change.</b></p> <p>In the 60,000 years since people began colonizing the continents, a recurring feature of human civilization has been <i>mobility - </i>the ever-constant search for resources and stability. Seismic global events - wars and genocides, revolutions and pandemics - have only accelerated the process. The map of humanity isn’t settled - not now, not ever.</p> <p>As climate change tips toward full-blown crisis, economies collapse, governments destabilize, and technology disrupts, we’re entering a new age of mass migrations - one that will scatter both the dispossessed and the well-off. Which areas will people abandon and where will they resettle? Which countries will accept or reject them? As today’s world population, which includes four billion restless youth, votes with their feet, what map of human geography will emerge?</p> <p>In <i>Move</i>, celebrated futurist Parag Khanna provides an illuminating and authoritative vision of the next phase of human civilization - one that is both mobile and sustainable. As the book explores, in the years ahead people will move people to where the resources are and technologies will flow to the people who need them, returning us to our nomadic roots while building more secure habitats.</p> <p>“An urgent, powerful argument for more open international borders” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review), <i>Move</i> is a fascinating look at the deep trends that are shaping the most likely scenarios for the future. Most important, it guides each of us as we determine <i>our </i>optimal location on humanity’s ever-changing map.</p>";
