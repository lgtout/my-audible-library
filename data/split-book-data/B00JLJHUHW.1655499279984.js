window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There’s a quiet revolution happening in the way we die. More than 1.5 million Americans a year die in hospice care - nearly 44 percent of all deaths - and a vast industry has sprung up to meet the growing demand. Once viewed as a New Age indulgence, hospice is now a $14 billion business and one of the most successful segments in health care. <i>Changing the Way We Die</i>, by award-winning journalists Fran Smith and Sheila Himmel, is the first book to take a broad, penetrating look at the hospice landscape, through gripping stories of real patients, families, and doctors, as well as the corporate giants that increasingly own the market. </p> <p><i>Changing the Way We Die</i> is a vital resource for anyone who wants to be prepared to face life’s most challenging and universal event. You will learn:</p> <ul> <li>Hospice use is soaring, yet most people come too late to get the full benefits.</li> <li>With the age tsunami, it becomes even more critical for families and patients to choose end-of-life care wisely.</li> <li>Hospice at its best is much more than a way to relieve the suffering of dying. It is a way to live.</li> </ul>";
