window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Drawing on an unprecedented range and variety of original research, <i>Hitler's Empire </i>sheds new light on how the Nazis designed, maintained, and lost their European dominion - and offers a chilling vision of what the world would have become had they won the war. Mark Mazower forces us to set aside timeworn opinions of the Third Reich, and instead shows how the party drew inspiration for its imperial expansion from America and Great Britain. Yet the Nazis' lack of political sophistication left them unequal to the task of ruling what their armies had conquered, despite a shocking level of cooperation from the overwhelmed countries. A work as authoritative as it is unique, <i>Hitler's Empire </i>is a surprising - and controversial - appraisal of the Third Reich's rise and ultimate fall.</p>";
