window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We've been taught that awakening is difficult, teaches Adyashanti, and that to wake up from the illusion of separation takes years. But all it really takes is a willingness to look into the depths of our experience here and now. In this refreshing \"non-meditation\" session, Adyashanti invites you to let go of all techniques, even the concept of yourself as a meditator, and just let everything be as it is. </p> <p>Sounds True Practices are short downloadable audio sessions selected from our most popular courses. Affordably priced and ideal for beginners, they're a powerful way to use energy healing, guided imagery, meditation, and other proven practices at home or on the go. Put them on your smartphone, MP3 player, tablet device, or computer...and start experiencing their benefits today. </p> <p>This session is excerpted from Adyashanti's <i>True Meditation</i>, available as a three-CD audio or in book-and-CD format. </p>";
