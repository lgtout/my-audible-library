window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In business, the right behaviors matter. But getting it right is tricky. Even when we acknowledge the need to change what we do and how we do it, life has a habit of getting in the way, upsetting even the best-laid plans. And just how do we manage those situations that can provoke even the most rational among us into behaving in ways we would rather forget? </p> <p><i>Triggers</i> confronts head on the challenges of behavior and change, looking at the external factors (or \"triggers\") - both negative and positive - that affect our behaviors, our awareness of when we need to change, our willingness (or otherwise) to do so, and our ability to see the change through. Drawing on his unparalleled experience as an international executive educator and coach, Marshall Goldsmith invites us to understand how our own beliefs and the environments in which we operate can trigger negative behaviors or a resistance to the need to change. But he also offers up some simple, practical advice to help us navigate the negative and make the most of the triggers that will help us to sustain positive change. </p>";
