window.bookSummaryJSON = "Gerd Gigerenzer is one of the researchers of behavioral intuition responsible for the science behind Malcolm Gladwell's bestseller <i>Blink</i>. Gladwell showed us how snap decisions often yield better results than careful analysis. Now, Gigerenzer explains why our intuition is such a powerful decision-making tool. <p> Drawing on a decade of research at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Gigerenzer demonstrates that our gut feelings are actually the result of unconscious mental processes - processes that apply rules of thumb that we've derived from our environment and prior experiences. The value of these unconscious rules lies precisely in their difference from rational analysis - they take into account only the most useful bits of information rather than attempting to evaluate all possible factors. By examining various decisions we make - how we choose a spouse, a stock, a medical procedure, or the answer to a million-dollar game show question - Gigerenzer shows how gut feelings not only lead to good practical decisions but also underlie the moral choices that make our society function.</p> <p> In the tradition of <i>Blink</i> and <i>Freakonomics</i>, <i>Gut Feelings</i> is an exploration of the myriad influences and factors (nature and nurture) that affect how the mind works, grounded in cutting-edge research and conveyed through compelling real-life examples.</p>";
