window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Learn how the perception of truth has been weaponized in modern politics with this \"insightful\" account of propaganda in Russia and beyond during the age of disinformation\" (<i>New York Times</i>)</p> <p>When information is a weapon, every opinion is an act of war.</p> <p>We live in a world of influence operations run amok, where dark ads, psyops, hacks, bots, soft facts, ISIS, Putin, trolls, and Trump seek to shape our very reality. In this surreal atmosphere created to disorient us and undermine our sense of truth, we've lost not only our grip on peace and democracy -- but our very notion of what those words even mean.</p> <p>Peter Pomerantsev takes us to the front lines of the disinformation age, where he meets Twitter revolutionaries and pop-up populists, \"behavioral change\" salesmen, Jihadi fanboys, Identitarians, truth cops, and many others. Forty years after his dissident parents were pursued by the KGB, Pomerantsev finds the Kremlin re-emerging as a great propaganda power. His research takes him back to Russia - but the answers he finds there are not what he expected.</p> <p>Blending reportage, family history, and intellectual adventure, <i>This Is Not Propaganda</i> explores how we can reimagine our politics and ourselves when reality seems to be coming apart.&nbsp;</p>";
