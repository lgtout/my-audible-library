window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A bold and urgent perspective on how American foreign policy must change in response to the shifting world order of the 21st century, from Andrew J. Bacevich, the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Limits of Power </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>The Age of Illusions</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>The purpose of US foreign policy has, at least theoretically, been to keep Americans safe. Yet as we confront a radically changed world, it has become indisputably clear that the terms of that policy have failed. Washington’s insistence that a market economy is compatible with the common good, its faith in the idea of the “West” and its “special relationships”, its conviction that global military primacy is the key to a stable and sustainable world order - these have brought endless wars and a succession of moral and material disasters.</p> <p>In a bold reconception of America’s place in the world, informed by thinking from across the political spectrum, Andrew J. Bacevich - founder and president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a bipartisan Washington think tank dedicated to foreign policy - lays down a new approach - one that is based on moral pragmatism, mutual coexistence, and war as a last resort. Confronting the threats of the future - accelerating climate change, a shift in the international balance of power, and the ascendance of information technology over brute weapons of war - his vision calls for nothing less than a profound overhaul of our understanding of national security.<br> <br> Crucial and provocative, <i>After the Apocalypse</i> sets out new principles to guide the once-but-no-longer sole superpower as it navigates a transformed world.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Metropolitan Books</b></p>";
