window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Republican Gomorrah</i> is a bestiary of dysfunction, scandal, and sordidness from the dark heart of the theocratic forces that now have a leash on the party. It shows how those forces are the ones that establishment Republicans, like John McCain, have to bow to if they have any hope of running for president. More that just an expos√©, <i>Republican Gomorrah</i> shows that many of the movement's leading figures are stained by crisis and scandal: depression, mental illness, extramarital affairs, struggles with homosexual urges, heavy medication, pornography addiction, serial domestic abuse, and even murder. <p>Inspired by the work of psychologist Erich Fromm, who asserted that the fear of freedom propels anxiety-ridden people into authoritarian settings, Blumenthal explains in a compelling narrative how a culture of personal crises has defined the radical right, transforming the Republican party for the next generation and setting the stage for the future of American politics.</p>";
