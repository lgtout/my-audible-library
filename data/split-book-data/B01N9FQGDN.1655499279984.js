window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cheap fashion has fundamentally changed the way most Americans dress. Stores ranging from discounters like Target to fast fashion chains like H&amp;M now offer the newest trends at unprecedentedly low prices. Retailers are producing clothes at enormous volumes in order to drive prices down and profits up, and they've turned clothing into a disposable good. After all, we have little reason to keep wearing and repairing the clothes we already own when styles change so fast and it's cheaper to just buy more. </p> <p>But what are we doing with all these cheap clothes? And more important, what are they doing to us, our society, our environment, and our economic well-being? In <i>Overdressed</i>, Elizabeth L. Cline sets out to uncover the true nature of the cheap fashion juggernaut, tracing the rise of budget clothing chains, the death of middle-market and independent retailÂ­ers, and the roots of our obsession with deals and steals. </p>";
