window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number One </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Best Seller&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>The epic story of the greatest quest in all of science - the holy grail of physics that would explain the creation of the universe - from renowned theoretical physicist and author of </b><b><i>The Future of the Mind</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Future of Humanity</i></b></p> <p>When Newton discovered the law of gravity, he unified the rules governing the heavens and the Earth. Since then, physicists have been placing new forces into ever-grander theories.</p> <p>But perhaps the ultimate challenge is achieving a monumental synthesis of the two remaining theories - relativity and the quantum theory. This would be the crowning achievement of science, a profound merging of all the forces of nature into one beautiful, magnificent equation to unlock the deepest mysteries in science: What happened before the Big Bang? What lies on the other side of a black hole? Are there other universes and dimensions? Is time travel possible? Why are we here?</p> <p>Kaku also explains the intense controversy swirling around this theory, with Nobel laureates taking opposite sides on this vital question. It is a captivating, gripping story; what’s at stake is nothing less than our conception of the universe.</p> <p>Written with Kaku’s trademark enthusiasm and clarity, this epic and engaging journey is the story of <i>The God Equation</i>.</p>";
