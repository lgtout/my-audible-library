window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b><br> <br> <b>A primer on Democratic Socialism for those who are extremely skeptical of it. </b></p> <p>America is witnessing the rise of a new generation of socialist activists. More young people support socialism now than at any time since the labor movement of the 1920s. The Democratic Socialists of America, a big-tent leftist organization, has just surpassed 50,000 members nationwide. In the fall of 2018, one of the most influential congressmen in the Democratic Party lost a primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old socialist who had never held office before. But what does all this mean? Should we be worried about our country, or should we join the march toward our bright socialist future? In <i>Why You Should Be a Socialist</i>, Nathan J. Robinson will give listeners a primer on 21st-century socialism: what it is, what it isn’t, and why everyone should want to be a part of this exciting new chapter of American politics.</p> <p>From the heyday of Occupy Wall Street through Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign and beyond, young progressives have been increasingly drawn to socialist ideas. However, the movement’s goals need to be defined more sharply before it can effect real change on a national scale. Likewise, liberals and conservatives will benefit from a deeper understanding of the true nature of this ideology, whether they agree with it or not.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Robinson’s charming, accessible, and well-argued book will convince even the most skeptical listeners of the merits of socialist thought. </b></p>";
