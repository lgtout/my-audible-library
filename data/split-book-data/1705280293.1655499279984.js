window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a major political event and a crucial turning point in the history of the People's Republic of China, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) marked the zenith as well as the nadir of Mao Zedong's ultra-leftist politics. Reacting in part to the Soviet Union's \"revisionism\" that he regarded as a threat to the future of socialism, Mao mobilized the masses in a battle against what he called \"bourgeois\" forces within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). This 10-year-long class struggle on a massive scale devastated traditional Chinese culture as well as the nation's economy.</p> <p>Following his groundbreaking and award-winning history of the Great Famine, <i>Tombstone</i>, Yang Jisheng here presents the only history of the Cultural Revolution by an independent scholar based in mainland China, and makes a crucial contribution to understanding those years' lasting influence today.</p> <p><i>The World Turned Upside Down</i> puts every political incident, major and minor, of those 10 years under extraordinary and withering scrutiny, and arrives in English at a moment when contemporary Chinese governance is leaning once more toward a highly centralized power structure and Mao-style cult of personality.</p>";
