It might very well be Wright’s most brilliantly crafted, and ominously foretelling, book.” (Kiese Laymon)</b></p> <p><b>A major literary event: an explosive, previously unpublished novel about race and violence in America by the legendary author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Native Son</i></b><b>&nbsp;and</b><b><i>&nbsp;Black Boy</i></b></p> <p>Fred Daniels, a Black man, is picked up by the police after a brutal double murder and tortured until he confesses to a crime he did not commit. After signing a confession, he escapes from custody and flees into the city’s sewer system.</p> <p>This is the devastating premise of this scorching novel, a never-before-seen masterpiece by Richard Wright. Written between his landmark books&nbsp;<i>Native Son</i>&nbsp;(1940) and&nbsp;<i>Black Boy</i>&nbsp;(1945), at the height of his creative powers, it would see publication in Wright's lifetime only in drastically condensed and truncated form, and ultimately be included in the posthumous short story collection&nbsp;<i>Eight Men</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, for the first time, by special arrangement with the author’s estate, the full text of the work that meant more to Wright than any other (“I have never written anything in my life that stemmed more from sheer inspiration”) is published in the form that he intended, complete with his companion essay, “Memories of My Grandmother”. Malcolm Wright, the author’s grandson, contributes an afterword.</p>";
