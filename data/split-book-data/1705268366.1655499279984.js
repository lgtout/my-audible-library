window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Spiritual teacher Thomas Hübl has spent years investigating why it is that old and seemingly disconnected traumas can seed their way through communities and across generations. His work culminates in <i>Healing Collective Trauma</i>, a new perspective on trauma that addresses both its visible effects and its most hidden roots. Thomas combines deep knowledge of mystical traditions with the latest scientific research. \"In this way\", writes Thomas, \"we are weaving a double helix between ancient wisdom and contemporary understanding\".&nbsp;</p> <p>Thomas details the Collective Trauma Integration Process, a group-based modality for evoking and eventually dissolving stuck traumatic energies. Providing structured practices for both students and group facilitators, <i>Healing Collective Trauma</i> is intended to build a practical tool kit for integration.&nbsp;</p> <p>Including essays contributed by experts such as Dr. Gabor Mate, Dr. Otto Scharmer, Dr. Christina Bethell, and Ken Wilber, <i>Healing Collective Trauma</i> offers not just an advanced look at community trauma but also a hopeful glimpse of the future. As Thomas declares, \"Together, I believe we can and must heal the 'soul wound' that marks us all. In so doing, we will awaken to the luminous possibility and profound potential of our true, mutual nature as humankind\".</p>";
