window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Young Stalin</i> tells the story of an exceptional, charismatic, darkly turbulent young man born into obscurity, fancying himself a poet and a priest, and finally embracing revolutionary idealism as his Messianic mission in life. Equal parts scholar and terrorist, a mastermind of bank robberies, extortion, piracy, and murder, he was so impressive in his brutality that Lenin made him, along with Trotsky, his chief henchman. <p> Here is Stalin the supreme dictator in the making - his psychology, his loves and hatreds, his intellectual interests, his knowledge of the world - learning how to triumph in the Kremlin and create the USSR in his profoundly flawed image.</p> <p> Based on exhaustive research and astonishing new evidence, <i>Young Stalin</i> is a brilliant prehistory of the USSR from the perspective of those who would bring it into being.</p>";
