window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Make small changes to your surroundings and create extraordinary happiness in your life with ground-breaking research from designer and TED star Ingrid Fetell Lee.</p> <p>Next Big Idea Club selection - chosen by Malcolm Gladwell, Susan Cain, Dan Pink, and Adam Grant as one of the \"two most ground-breaking new nonfiction reads of the season!\"</p> <p>\"This book has the power to change everything! Writing with depth, wit, and insight, Ingrid Fetell Lee shares all you need to know in order to create external environments that give rise to inner joy.\" (Susan Cain, author of Quiet and founder of Quiet Revolution)</p> <p>Have you ever wondered why we stop to watch the orange glow that arrives before sunset or why we flock to see cherry blossoms bloom in spring? Is there a reason people - regardless of gender, age, culture, or ethnicity - are mesmerized by baby animals and can't help but smile when they see a burst of confetti or a cluster of colorful balloons?</p> <p>We are often made to feel that the physical world has little or no impact on our inner joy. Increasingly, experts urge us to find balance and calm by looking inward - through mindfulness or meditation - and muting the outside world. But what if the natural vibrancy of our surroundings is actually our most renewable and easily accessible source of joy?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>Joyful</i>, designer Ingrid Fetell Lee explores how the seemingly mundane spaces and objects we interact with every day have surprising and powerful effects on our mood. Drawing on insights from neuroscience and psychology, she explains why one setting makes us feel anxious or competitive while another fosters acceptance and delight - and, most importantly, she reveals how we can harness the power of our surroundings to live fuller, healthier, and truly joyful lives.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
