window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program includes an introduction and epilogue read by the author. </b></p> <p><b>Blending evidence across science and design, </b><b><i>Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less</i></b><b> offers a revolution in problem-solving: proving why we overlook subtraction, and how we can access its true potential.</b></p> <p>We pile on “to-dos” but don’t consider “stop-doings”. We create incentives for good behavior, but don’t get rid of obstacles to it. We collect new-and-improved ideas, but don’t prune the outdated ones. Every day, across challenges big and small, we neglect a basic way to make things better: We don’t subtract.</p> <p>Leidy Klotz’s pioneering research shows why. Whether we’re building Lego models or cities, grilled-cheese sandwiches or strategic plans, our minds tend to add before taking away. Even when we do think of it, subtraction can be harder to pull off because an array of biological, cultural, and economic forces push us toward <i>more</i>. But we have a choice - our blind spot need not go on taking its toll on our cities, our institutions, and our minds. By diagnosing our neglect of subtraction, we can treat it.</p> <p><i>Subtract</i> will change how you change your world. In these pages you’ll meet subtracting exemplars: design geniuses, Nobel Prize-winners, rock-stars, and everyday heroes, who have subtracted to dismantle racism, advance knowledge, heal the planet, and even tell better jokes. These and more guiding lights show how we can revolutionize not just our day-to-day lives, but our collective legacy. A paradigm shift of a book, <i>Subtract</i> shows us how to find more of the options we’ve been missing - and empowers us to pursue them.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books</b></p> <p>“This is a captivating, perceptive read on one of the most basic mistakes that we make in the pursuit of success and happiness.... If the defining word of your life is ‘more’, you need to read this book.” (Adam Grant, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Think Again </i>and <i>Originals,</i> and host of the TED podcast <i>WorkLife</i>)</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
