window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An essential journey through the American South - and the way it defines American identity - from one of our most extraordinary writers on race and culture at work today.</b></p> <p>We all think we know the South. Even those who have never lived there, who have never even been there,&nbsp;can rattle off a list of&nbsp;signifiers that define the South for them:&nbsp;<i>Gone with the Wind</i>, the Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan, cotillions, plantations, football,&nbsp;Jim Crow, and, of course, slavery.&nbsp;For those who&nbsp;live outside the region, the South is very much about&nbsp;the profound difference between “us” and “them”. In&nbsp;<i>South to America</i>, Imani Perry shows in&nbsp;detail by infinitely careful detail that the meaning of&nbsp;<i>American</i>&nbsp;is inextricably linked with the South, and if we are American, we are all at least a little bit Southern.</p> <p>In looking at the American South through a historic, personal, and anecdotal lens, Perry argues that the South is in fact the nation’s heartland. The formation of our country, our wealth, and our politics have always pivoted around the resource-rich region. A native of Alabama but raised in the North, Perry returns to the South - the place she has always called home - traveling through its cities and their cultural formations, studying its historical figures and institutions and the natural settings from which they sprang. Seeing the South as familiar and&nbsp;anew, Perry goes on a journey that brings her in contact with Southerners from all walks of life. She renders them with sensitivity and honesty, in addition to sharing her thoughts about a troubling history and the ritual humiliations and joys that characterize so much of Southern life.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the story of a woman going home - a Black woman and a Southern home - at a time when ideas of how the South should be are rising once again.&nbsp;<i>South to America</i> is an assertion that if we do indeed want to build a more humane future for the United States, we must center our concern below the Mason-Dixon Line.</p>";
