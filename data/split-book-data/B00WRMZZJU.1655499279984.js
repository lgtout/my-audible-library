window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do you overthink before taking action? Are you prone to making negative predictions? Do you worry about the worst that could happen? Do you take negative feedback very hard? Are you self-critical? Does anything less than perfect performance feel like failure? </p> <p>If any of these issues resonate with you, you're probably suffering from some degree of anxiety, and you're not alone. The good news: While reducing your anxiety level to zero isn't possible or useful (anxiety can actually be helpful!), you can learn to successfully manage symptoms - such as excessive rumination, hesitation, fear of criticism, and paralysing perfection. </p> <p>In <i>The Anxiety Toolkit</i>, Dr. Alice Boyes translates powerful, evidence-based tools used in therapy clinics into tips and tricks you can employ in everyday life. Whether you have an anxiety disorder, or are just anxiety-prone by nature, you'll discover how anxiety works, strategies to help you cope with common anxiety \"stuck\" points and a confidence that - anxious or not - you have all the tools you need to succeed in life and work. </p>";
