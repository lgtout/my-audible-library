window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>Best Seller • </b></p> <p><b>With unparalleled reporting, a Pulitzer Prize-winning </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>reporter chronicles the clash between a president and the officials of his own government who tried to stop him.</b></p> <p><b>“A meticulously reported volume that clearly benefits from the author’s extraordinary access...[a] startling dissection of the Trump presidency.” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Drawing on secret FBI and White House documents and confidential sources inside federal law enforcement and the West Wing, <i>Donald Trump v. The United States</i> tells the dramatic, high-stakes story of those who felt compelled to confront and try to contain the 45th president of the United States as he shredded norms and sought to expand his power, bringing American democracy to the brink.</p> <p>Michael S. Schmidt broke many of the major stories of the Trump era, from the news of Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email account to the report on the memos of former FBI director James Comey’s conversations with Trump that led directly to the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. In <i>Donald Trump v. The United States,</i> Schmidt takes us inside the defining events of a presidency, chronicling the clash between an increasingly emboldened president and the officials of his own government who found themselves trying to thwart the president they had once pledged to serve. Through their eyes and ears, we observe an epic struggle to stop a rogue agent in our nation’s highest office. A vital work of journalism, <i>Donald Trump v. The United States</i> is a riveting contemporary history and a lasting account of just how fragile and vulnerable American democracy really is.</p>";
