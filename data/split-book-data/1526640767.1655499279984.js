window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bloomsbury presents </b><b><i>Return of a King</i></b><b> by William Dalrymple, read by Sagar Arya.</b></p> <p><b>Shortlisted for The Samuel Johnson Prize 2013</b></p> <p>In the spring of 1839, Britain invaded Afghanistan for the first time. Nearly 20,000 British and East India Company troops poured through the high mountain passes and re-established on the throne Shah Shuja ul-Mulk.</p> <p>On the way in, the British faced little resistance. But after two years of occupation, the Afghan people rose in answer to the call for jihad and the country exploded into violent rebellion. The First Anglo-Afghan War ended in Britain's greatest military humiliation of the 19th century: an entire army of the then most powerful nation in the world ambushed in retreat and utterly routed by poorly equipped tribesmen.</p> <p>Using a range of forgotten Afghan and Indian sources, William Dalrymple's masterful retelling of Britain's greatest imperial disaster is a powerful parable of colonial ambition and cultural collision, folly and hubris. <i>Return of a King</i> is history at its most urgent and important.</p>";
