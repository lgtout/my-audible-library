window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ever noticed that trying to calm down often produces more agitation? That trying to change bad habits can seem impossible? Or that real fulfillment can be elusive, despite living a successful life?&nbsp;</p> <p>Often, such difficulties stem from the human brain's hardwired tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Modern science demonstrates that this survival mechanism served the needs of our earliest ancestors, but is at the root of many problems that we face today, such as depression, compulsive and addictive behaviors, chronic pain, and stress and anxiety.&nbsp;</p> <p>For thousands of years, people have used mindfulness practices to deal effectively with a wide range of life challenges. But how exactly does mindfulness work, in scientific terms? How can the human brain, which gives rise to so many of our problems, actually provide a solution?&nbsp;</p> <p>We are now in the midst of an explosion of scientific research demonstrating that mindfulness practice changes both the function and the structure of the brain. Numerous studies show which parts of the brain are affected by mindfulness practice, and how these neurobiological changes benefit our minds and bodies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now, in the 24 fascinating lectures of <i>The Science of Mindfulness</i>, Professor Siegel, a clinical psychologist at Harvard Medical School, reveals the science behind mindfulness in compelling detail and demonstrates its application to a wide range of issues - psychological, social, and medical. You'll examine the neurobiology underlying ancient practices that are now profoundly influencing the contemporary world. And you'll learn many practical ways you can use mindfulness techniques in your own life.&nbsp;</p> <p>This playful, caring course demonstrates the effectiveness of mindfulness in responding to many of humanity's fundamental existential problems.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, this audiobook has complementary soundtracks, which are included in the audiobook from chapters 25 to 29.</p>";
