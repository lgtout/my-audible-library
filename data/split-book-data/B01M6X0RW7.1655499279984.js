window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine what you could do with the time you spend writing emails every day. </p> <p>Complexity is killing companies' ability to innovate and adapt, and simplicity is fast becoming the competitive advantage of our time. <i>Why Simple Wins</i> helps leaders and their teams move beyond the feelings of frustration and futility that come with so much unproductive work in today's corporate world to create a corporate culture where valuable, essential, meaningful work is the norm. By learning how to eliminate redundancies, communicate with clarity, and make simplification a habit, individuals and companies can begin to recognize which activities are time-sucks and which create lasting value. </p> <p>Lisa Bodell's simplification method has several unique principles: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Simplification is a skill that's available to us all, yet very few leaders use it. </li> <li>Simplification is the right thing to do - for our customers, for our company, and for each other. Operating with simplification as our core business model will make it easier to be respectful of each other's time. </li> <li>Simplification drives culture, and culture in turn drives employee engagement, customer relations, and overall productivity. </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>This book is inspired by Bodell's passion for eliminating barriers to innovation and productivity. In it, she explains why change and innovation are so hard to achieve - and it's not what you might expect. The reality is this: we spend our days drowning in mundane tasks like meetings, emails, and reports. These are often self-created complexities that prevent us from getting to the meaningful work that truly matters. </p> <p>Using simple stories and techniques, <i>Why Simple Wins</i> shows that by using simplicity as an operating principle, we can eliminate the busy work that puts a chokehold on us every day, and instead spend time on the work that we value. </p>";
