window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Waking Up</i></b><b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</b><b><i>The End of Faith</i></b><b>, a collection of the best conversations from wildly popular, often controversial podcast </b><b><i>Making Sense</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p><b>“Civilization rests on a series of successful conversations.” (Sam Harris)</b></p> <p>Sam Harris - neuroscientist, philosopher, and best-selling author - has been exploring some of the most important questions about the human mind, society, and current events on his podcast,<i>&nbsp;Making Sense</i>. With more than one million downloads per episode, these discussions have clearly hit a nerve, frequently walking a tightrope where either host or guest - and sometimes both - lose their footing, but always in search of a greater understanding of the world in which we live. For Harris, honest conversation, no matter how difficult or controversial, represents the only path to moral and intellectual progress.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<i>Making Sense</i> audiobook includes talks with Daniel Kahneman, Timothy Snyder, Nick Bostrom, and Glen Loury, on topics that range from the nature of consciousness and free will, to politics and extremism, to living ethically. Together they shine a light on what it means to “make sense” in the modern world.&nbsp;</p>";
