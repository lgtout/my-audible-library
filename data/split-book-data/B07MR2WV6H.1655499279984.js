window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Itâ€™s the reason why spending time on Facebook makes us feel sad and lonely. Why expensive name-brand medicines provide better pain relief than the generic stuff, even if they share the same ingredients. And why a hospital room with a good view speeds up recovery from surgery.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The truth is the way we think about ourselves and the world around us dramatically impacts our happiness, health, how fast or slow we age, and even how long we live. In fact, people with a positive mindset about aging live on average 7.5 years longer than those without.&nbsp;</p> <p>That might sound alarming to those of us who struggle to see the bright side, but the good news is we can make surprisingly simple changes or small shifts to how we think, feel, and act that will really pay off.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Positive Shift: Mastering Mindset to Improve Happiness, Health, and Longevity</i>, Dr. Catherine Sanderson breaks down the science of thought and shows how our mindset - or thought pattern - exerts a substantial influence on our psychological and physical health. Most important, this book demonstrates how, no matter what our natural tendency, with practice we can make minor tweaks in our mindset that will improve the quality - and longevity - of our life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Combining cutting-edge research from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and medicine, as well as vivid real-world examples of the power of mindset, <i>The Positive Shift </i>gives listeners practical and easy strategies for changing maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors, so they can live longer, happier lives. These behaviors include:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><b>Appreciating nature</b>, with actions as simple as eating lunch outside</li> <li><b>Giving to others</b>, like volunteering</li> <li><b>Spending money on experiences</b>, not possessions&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Living your best life is truly mind over matter. Believe in yourself, and rethink your way to a happier reality.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
