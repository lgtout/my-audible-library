window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From one of America's most celebrated psychiatrists, the book that has taught generations of healers why healing the sick is about more than just diagnosing their illness.</b></p> <p>Modern medicine treats sick patients like broken machines - figure out what is physically wrong, fix it, and send the patient on their way. But humans are not machines. When we are ill, we experience our illness: We become scared, distressed, tired, weary. Our illnesses are not just biological conditions, but human ones.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was Arthur Kleinman, a Harvard psychiatrist and anthropologist, who saw this truth when most of his fellow doctors did not. Based on decades of clinical experience studying and treating chronic illness, <i>The Illness Narratives</i> makes a case for interpreting the illness experience of patients as a core feature of doctoring.</p> <p>Before <i>Being Mortal</i>, there was <i>The Illness Narratives</i>. It remains today a prescient and passionate case for bridging the gap between patient and practitioner.&nbsp;</p>";
