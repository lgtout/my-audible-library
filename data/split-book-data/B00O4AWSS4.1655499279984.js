window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Warning: Using this book could be hazardous to your ego! The slogans it contains are designed to awaken the heart and cultivate love and kindness toward others. They are revolutionary in that practicing them fosters abandonment of personal territory in relating to others and in understanding the world as it is. </p> <p>The 59 provocative slogans presented here - each with a commentary by the Tibetan meditation master Chgyam Trungpa - have been used by Tibetan Buddhists for eight centuries to help meditation students remember and focus on important principles and practices of mind training. They emphasize meeting the ordinary situations of life with intelligence and compassion under all circumstances. Slogans include, \"Don't be swayed by external circumstances,\" \"Be grateful to everyone,\" and \"Always maintain only a joyful mind. \"This edition contains a new foreword by Pema Chodron.</p>";
