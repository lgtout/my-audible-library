window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Combining classical Marxism, psychoanalysis, and the new labor history pioneered by E. P. Thompson and Herbert Gutman, David Roediger's widely acclaimed book provides an original study of the formative years of working-class racism in the United States. This, he argues, cannot be explained simply with reference to economic advantage; rather, white working-class racism is underpinned by a complex series of psychological and ideological mechanisms that reinforce racial stereotypes, and thus help to forge the identities of white workers in opposition to Blacks. </p> <p>In a new preface, Roediger reflects on the reception, influence, and critical response to <i>The Wages of Whiteness</i>, while Kathleen Cleaver's insightful introduction hails the importance of a work that has become a classic. </p>";
