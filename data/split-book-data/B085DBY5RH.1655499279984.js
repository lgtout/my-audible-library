window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Is meditation an escape from - or a solution to - our psychological problems? Is the use of antidepressants counter to spiritual practice? Does a psychological approach to meditation reduce spirituality to \"self-help\"? What can Zen and psychoanalysis teach us about the problems of the mind and suffering?</p> <p>Psychiatrist and Zen teacher Barry Magid is uniquely qualified to answer questions like these. Written in an engaging and witty style, Ordinary Mind helps us understand challenging ideas - like Zen Buddhism's concepts of oneness, emptiness, and enlightenment - and how they make sense, not only within psychoanalytic conceptions of mind, but in the realities of our lives and relationships.</p>";
