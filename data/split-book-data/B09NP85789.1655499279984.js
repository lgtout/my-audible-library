window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"This disturbing but very important book makes clear we must dig deeper than the normal solutions we are offered.\" (Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia Works)</p> <p><i>Bright Green Lies </i>exposes the hypocrisy and bankruptcy of leading environmental groups and their most prominent cheerleaders. The best-known environmentalists are not in the business of speaking truth, or even holding up rational solutions to blunt the impending ecocide, but instead indulge in a mendacious and self-serving delusion that provides comfort at the expense of reality. They fail to state the obvious: We cannot continue to wallow in hedonistic consumption and industrial expansion and survive as a species.&nbsp;</p> <p>The environmental debate, Derrick Jensen and his coauthors argue, has been distorted by hubris and the childish desire by those in industrialized nations to sustain the unsustainable. All debates about environmental policy need to begin with honoring and protecting, not the desires of the human species, but with the sanctity of the Earth itself. We refuse to ask the right questions because these questions expose a stark truth - we cannot continue to live as we are living. To do so is suicidal folly.</p>";
