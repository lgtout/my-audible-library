window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Today, feminism is no longer a dirty word, and women purporting to stand up for women's equality now include high-powered names like Beyonc√©, Taylor Swift, and Emma Watson. Hip underwear lines sell granny pants with \"feminist\" emblazoned on the back. In every bookstore there are scores of seductive feminist how-to business guides telling women how to achieve \"it all\". Meanwhile, access to abortion clinics is growing ever more difficult for many women across the country, and Arizona has passed a law requiring doctors to tell women undergoing abortive procedures about a junk science method of \"reversing\" abortion espoused by the Tea Party right. Feminism has gone mainstream, but true equality is never an easy sell. </p> <p>Here, Andi Zeisler exposes how feminism has transformed into something barely warranting the name, ignoring the many for the one, shamelessly colluding with market forces and popular culture. Witty and fearless, <i>We Were Feminists Once</i> is the story of how we could have let this happen and where we go from here. </p>";
