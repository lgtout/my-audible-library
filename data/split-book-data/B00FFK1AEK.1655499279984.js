window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A startling history of modern Afghanistan - the story of a country caught in a vortex of terror. Veteran defense analyst David Isby provides an insightful and meticulously researched look at the current situation in Afghanistan, her history, and what he believes must be done so that the U.S. and NATO coalition can succeed in what has historically been known as “the graveyard of empires.” </p> <p>Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world with one of the lowest literacy rates. It is rife with divisions between ethnic groups that dwarf current schisms in Iraq, along with conflicts between rogue factions from Pakistan, with whom relations are increasingly strained. </p> <p>The task of implementing an effective American policy and cementing Afghan rule is hampered by what Isby sees as separate but overlapping conflicts between terrorism, narcotics, and regional rivalries, each presenting separate yet equally challenging issues to resolve. This book provides the road map to overcoming these obstacles and finding a way forward for the U.S. and the Afghan nation. </p>";
