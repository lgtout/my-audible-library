window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tracing postmodernism from its roots in Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant to their development in thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Richard Rorty, philosopher Stephen Hicks provides a provocative account of why postmodernism has been the most vigorous intellectual movement of the late 20th century.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why do skeptical and relativistic arguments have such power in the contemporary intellectual world? Why do they have that power in the humanities but not in the sciences? Why has a significant portion of the political left - the same left that traditionally promoted reason, science, equality for all, and optimism - now switched to themes of anti-reason, anti-science, double standards, and cynicism?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Explaining Postmodernism</i> is intellectual history with a polemical twist, providing fresh insights into the debates underlying the furor over political correctness, multiculturalism, and the future of liberal democracy.&nbsp;</p> <p>This expanded edition includes two additional essays by Stephen Hicks: \"Free Speech and Postmodernism\" and \"From Modern to Postmodern Art: Why Art Became Ugly\".</p>";
