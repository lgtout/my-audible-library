window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why did Hitler persecute the Jews? This is what everyone is asking. Even though many years have passed since those dire events, the world will never forget everything that happened. Was there something behind his madness? Maybe there was an ideology that went beyond what everyone knows? For some, yes.</p> <p>According to some scholars, Adolf Hitler hid a truth that went far beyond all expectations. The Führer seems to have been a follower of a philosophical and religious movement called Ariosophy. This movement was based on magical and esoteric ideologies inspired by the teachings of some particular figures of the society of the time. The so-called \"spiritual masters\" of Ariosophy were Guido von List, Lanz von Liebenfels, Savitri Devi, and Miguel Serrano. The term \"Ariosophy\" is based on the word \"Aryan\", on which the insane Führer based his entire struggle against the Jews.</p> <p>The different components that implied the occult ideology of National Socialism have never been openly declared nor have a syncretic and complete vision of them ever been had. The only historical-cultural moment of National Socialism in power in which this synthesis was sought was the decade that went from 1935 to 1945. On January 5, 1919, the 35-year-old railway worker Anton Drexler founded, together with a small handful of companions, the Deutsche Arbeitpartei, the German Workers' Party, a new socialist political group with clearly reformist ideals.</p> <p>A pamphlet entitled \"My Political Awakening\" had imposed Drexler on the public stage. The ultimate goal of this railway worker and his movement was in fact to bring the working masses closer to the new ideal of national socialism, thus removing them from the influence of the young Marxism. At the same time, a recently born cultural and political society, which we will discuss shortly, had shown itself intrigued by the new developments that the Drexler movement could have brought about within the working class. Thule society soon showed itself in favor of these ideals while also trying to create a sort of bridgehead between it and the same political movement. The police, and the state security services, obviously could not be considered \"excluded\" from such mass unrest, which, although initially moderate enough, could have contributed and constituted the cradle from which new insurrectional and anti-government ideals could sprout.</p> <p>Thus, at the state level, a certain Adolf Hitler was sent to monitor the movements and trends that Drexler's creation seemed to want to assume. Sometimes, however, ideals can take precedence over duties to the point that a young Hitler will soon find himself becoming an extremely active member of the party, to the point that after only four months of his arrival the party was, on his advice, renamed \"National Socialist Party of German Workers\". Finally, a short time later, in May 1920, the Swastika became the symbol of the newly formed NSDAP. In short, this was the story that Nazism lived at the time of its foundation.</p> <p>This is what can be found in history books or a regular encyclopedia. However, these texts are silent on other attitudes and tendencies that were typical of this historical period, events, and characters who also played a considerable role in the genesis of Nazism itself. In fact, since its beginnings, numerous esotericists, lovers of arcane sciences, philosophers, and theorists of new religions joined and were supported by high hierarchs of Nazism, probably contributing to shaping certain ideas and programs that would soon be updated. Hitler himself during an interview, granted when he was already in power, externalized concepts and ideals that, even today, are difficult to interpret except by placing them within that vein of mysticism and esotericism that probably followed the Nazi ideal.</p>";
