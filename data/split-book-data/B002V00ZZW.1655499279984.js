window.bookSummaryJSON = "The Assassins' Gate, so dubbed by American soldiers, is the entrance to the American zone in the city of Baghdad. In 2003, the United States blazed into Iraq to depose dictator Saddam Hussein. But after three years and unknown thousands killed, that country faces an escalating civil war and an uncertain fate. How did it get to this point? <p> Rich in history and political insight, this is an important contribution to the ongoing dialogue over the Iraq War. George Packer describes the players and ideas behind the Bush administration's war policy. He also provides first-hand accounts of the men and women, both civilian and military, coalition and Iraqi, who are caught in the middle of the conflict.</p> <p> Winner of the Robert F. Kennedy Award, George Packer is a venerated staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> with four tours on assignment in Iraq. With <i>The Assassins' Gate</i>, he offers a penetrating work of journalism.</p>";
