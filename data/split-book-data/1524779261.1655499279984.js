Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</p> <p>Learn how to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy)</li> <li>Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower</li> <li>Design your environment to make success easier</li> <li>Get back on track when you fall off course</li> <li>And much more</li> </ul> <p><i>Atomic Habits</i> will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits - whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>";
