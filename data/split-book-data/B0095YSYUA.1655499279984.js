window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>We have more choices than we realize. In fact, according to positive psychology expert Tal Ben-Shahar, our entire life is made of choices, large and small. It is what we choose moment by moment and day by day - to do, to feel, to experience - that determines how happy and fulfilled we are. Every moment, then, is an opportunity to make a choice that will bring us greater happiness. </p> <p>Ben- Shahar presents 100 such opportunities, some simple, such as whether to frown or smile; others complex, such as whether to hold on to what we know or change our perspective - helping us identify them, recognize their importance, and make the right choice. Each choice includes a brief explanation plus a story or study that makes it accessible and relatable. Itâ€™s up to you to choose the life you want!</p>";
