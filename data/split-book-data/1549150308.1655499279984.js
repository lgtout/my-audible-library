window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestseller </b><b><i>So You Want to Talk About Race</i></b><b>, an&nbsp;“illuminating” (</b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>) history of white male identity.</b></p> <p>What happens to a country that tells generation after generation of white men that they deserve power? What happens when success is defined by status over women and people of color, instead of by actual accomplishments?</p> <p>Through the last 150 years of American history—from the post-reconstruction South and the mythic stories of cowboys in the West, to the present-day controversy over NFL protests and the backlash against the rise of women in politics—Ijeoma Oluo exposes the devastating consequences of white male supremacy on women, people of color, and white men themselves. <i>Mediocre </i>investigates the real costs of this phenomenon in order to imagine a new white male identity, one free from racism and sexism.</p> <p>As provocative as it is essential, this book will upend everything you thought you knew about American identity and offers a bold new vision of American greatness.</p>";
