window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From environmental activist, renowned crusader, champion fighter, maverick — a book that looks at our present situation with water and&nbsp;shows us how&nbsp;we can each take action to make changes in our cities, towns, and villages, before it is too late.</p> <p>\"Brockovich is a vocal, no-nonsense writer - Roberts might even have downplayed her fire in the movie.... The tales she tells show how addressing water issues at the source can make a big difference all the way down the chain.\" (Heather Hansman, <i>Outside</i>)</p> <p>\"Brockovich urges people to continue to fight for what they believe in.... [Her] belief in individual activism - rather than relying on leaders, corporations, or the government to handle the water crisis - is the guiding theme in her new book...inspirational.\" (Sam Gillette, <i>People</i>)</p> <p>In Erin Brockovich’s long-awaited book — her first to reckon with conditions on our planet — she makes clear why we are in the trouble we’re in, and how, in large and practical ways, we each can take actions to bring about change.</p> <p>She shows us what's at stake, and writes of the fraudulent science that disguises these issues, along with cancer clusters not being reported. She writes of the saga of PG&amp;E that continues to this day, and of the communities and people she has worked with who have helped to make an impact. She writes of the water operator in Poughkeepsie, New York, who responded to his customers' concerns and changed his system to create some of the safest water in the country; of the moms in Hannibal, Missouri, who became the first citizens in the nation to file an ordinance prohibiting the use of ammonia in their public drinking water; and about how we can protect our right to clean water by fighting for better enforcement of the laws, new legislation, and better regulations.</p> <p>She cannot fight all battles for all people and gives us the tools to take actions ourselves, have our voices heard, and know that steps are being taken to make sure our water is safe to drink and use.&nbsp;</p>";
