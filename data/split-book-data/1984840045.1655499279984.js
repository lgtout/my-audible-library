window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Monk of Mokha </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>The Circle </i></b><b>comes a taut, suspenseful story of two foreigners' role in a nation's fragile peace. </b></p> <p>An unnamed country is leaving the darkness of a decade at war, and to commemorate the armistice, the government commissions a new road connecting two halves of the state.&nbsp;</p> <p>Two men, foreign contractors from the same company, are sent to finish the highway. While one is flighty and adventurous, wanting to experience the nightlife and people, the other wants only to do the work and go home. But both men must eventually face the absurdities of their positions and the dire consequences of their presence.&nbsp;</p> <p>With echoes of J. M. Coetzee and Graham Greene, this timeless novel questions whether we can ever understand another nation's war and what role we have in forging anyone's peace.</p>";
