window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How do master storytellers compel us? There have been many attempts to understand what makes a good story, but few have used a scientific approach. In <i>The Science of Storytelling</i>, Will Storr applies dazzling psychological research and cutting-edge neuroscience to our myths and archetypes to show how we can tell better stories, revealing, among other things, how storytellers - and also our brains - create worlds by being attuned to moments of unexpected change.</p> <p>Storr’s superbly chosen examples range from Harry Potter to Jane Austen to Alice Walker, Greek drama to Russian novels to Native American folk tales, <i>King Lear</i> to <i>Breaking Bad</i> to children’s stories. With chapters such as \"The Dramatic Question\" and \"Plot, Endings, and Meaning\" and a practical, step-by-step appendix dedicated to \"The Sacred Flaw Approach\", <i>The Science of Storytelling</i> is destined to become an invaluable resource for writers of all stripes, whether novelist, screenwriter, playwright, or writer of creative or traditional nonfiction.</p>";
