window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ever notice that all watch ads show 10:10 as the time? Or that all fast-food restaurants use red or yellow in their logos? Or that certain stores are</b> <b><i>always</i></b> <b>having a sale? </b></p> <p>You may not be aware of these details, yet they’ve been influencing you all along.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every time you purchase, swipe, or click, marketers are able to more accurately predict your behavior. These days, brands know more about you than you know about yourself.&nbsp;<i>Blindsight</i>&nbsp;is here to change that.&nbsp;</p> <p>With eye-opening science, engaging stories, and fascinating real-world examples, neuroscientist Matt Johnson and marketer Prince Ghuman dive deep into the surprising relationship between brains and brands. In&nbsp;<i>Blindsight</i>, they showcase how marketing taps every aspect of our mental lives, covering the neuroscience of pain and pleasure, emotion and logic, fear and safety, attention and addiction, and much more.&nbsp;</p> <p>We like to think of ourselves as independent actors in control of our decisions, but the truth is far more complicated.&nbsp;<i>Blindsight</i>&nbsp;will give you the ability to see the unseeable when it comes to marketing so you can consume on your own terms. On the surface, you will learn how the brain works and how brands design for it. But peel back a layer, and you’ll find a sharper image of your psychology, reflected in your consumer behavior.&nbsp;</p> <p>This audiobook will change the way you view not just branding, but yourself, too.</p>";
