window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Upon his death in 1997, Viktor E. Frankl was lauded as one of the most influential thinkers of our time. <i>The Unheard Cry for Meaning</i> marked his return to the humanism that made <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i> a best seller around the world. </p> <p>In these selected essays, written between 1947 and 1977, Dr. Frankl illustrates the vital importance of the human dimension in psychotherapy. Using a wide range of subjects—including sex, mortality, modern literature, competitive athletics, and philosophy—he raises a lone voice against the pseudo-humanism that has invaded popular psychology and psychoanalysis. By exploring mankind’s remarkable qualities, he brilliantly celebrates each individual’s unique potential, while preserving the invaluable traditions of both Freudian analysis and behaviorism.</p>";
