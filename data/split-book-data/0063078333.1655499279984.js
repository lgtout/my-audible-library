window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><b> Bestseller</b></p> <p><b>The </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>’s&nbsp;Global Economics Correspondent masterfully reveals how billionaires’ systematic plunder of the world—brazenly accelerated during the pandemic—has transformed 21st-century life and dangerously destabilized democracy. </b></p> <p><b>\"</b><b><i>Davos Man</i></b><b>&nbsp;will be read a hundred years from now as a warning.\"—EVAN OSNOS</b></p> <p><b>“Excellent. A powerful, fiery book, and it could well be an essential one.\"—NPR.org</b></p> <p>The history of the last half century in America, Europe, and other major economies is in large part the story of wealth flowing upward. The most affluent&nbsp;people emerged from capitalism's triumph&nbsp;in the Cold War to loot the peace, depriving governments of the resources needed to serve their people, and leaving them tragically unprepared for the worst pandemic in a century.</p> <p>Drawing on decades of experience covering the global economy, award-winning journalist Peter S. Goodman profiles five representative \"Davos Men\"–members of the billionaire class–chronicling how their shocking exploitation of the global pandemic has hastened a fifty-year trend of wealth centralization. Alongside this reporting, Goodman delivers textured portraits of those caught in Davos Man’s wake, including a former steelworker in the American Midwest, a Bangladeshi migrant in Qatar, a Seattle doctor on the front lines of the fight against COVID, blue-collar workers in the tenements of Buenos Aires, an African immigrant in Sweden, a textile manufacturer in Italy, an Amazon warehouse employee in New York City, and more.</p> <p>Goodman’s rollicking and revelatory&nbsp;exposé&nbsp;of the global billionaire class reveals their hidden impact on nearly every aspect of modern society: widening wealth inequality, the rise of anti-democratic nationalism, the shrinking opportunity to earn a livable wage, the vulnerabilities of our health-care systems, access to affordable housing, unequal taxation, and even the quality of the shirt on your back. Meticulously reported yet compulsively readable, <i>Davos Man</i> is an essential read for anyone concerned about economic justice, the capacity of societies to grapple with their greatest challenges, and the sanctity of representative government.&nbsp;</p>";
