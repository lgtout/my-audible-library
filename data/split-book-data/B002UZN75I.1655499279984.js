window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>, an American classic, is the luminous and haunting novel about Janie Crawford, a Southern Black woman in the 1930s, whose journey from a free-spirited girl to a woman of independence and substance has inspired writers and readers for close to 70 years. <p>This poetic, graceful love story, rooted in Black folk traditions and steeped in mythic realism, celebrates boldly and brilliantly African-American culture and heritage. And in a powerful, mesmerizing narrative, it pays quiet tribute to a Black woman who, though constricted by the times, still demanded to be heard.</p> <p>Originally published in 1937 and long out of print, the book was reissued in 1975 and nearly three decades later <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> is considered a seminal novel in American fiction.</p>";
