window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A fascinating, irreverent guide to human evolution and what it means for our bodies today</b></p> <p>An eye-opening look into <i>why</i> our bodies work—or don't—the way they do. From blurry vision to crooked teeth, ACLs that tear at alarming rates and spines that seem to spend a lifetime falling apart, it's a curious thing that human beings have beaten the odds as a species. After all, we're the only survivors on our branch of the tree of life. Why is it that human mothers have such a life-endangering experience giving birth? And why are there entire medical specialties for teeth and feet? In this funny, wide-ranging and often surprising book, biologist Alex Bezzerides tells us just where we inherited our adaptable, achy, brilliant bodies in the process of evolution.</p> <p>The book traces the delightfully unexpected answers to these questions and many more:</p> <p>Why do we blink?</p> <p>Why don't our teeth regularly fit in our mouths?</p> <p>Why do women menstruate when so many other mammals don't?</p> <p>Why did humans stand up on two legs in the first place?</p>";
