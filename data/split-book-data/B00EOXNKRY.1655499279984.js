window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Focus</i>, Psychologist and journalist Daniel Goleman, author of the #1 international best-seller <i>Emotional Intelligence</i>, offers a groundbreaking look at today's scarcest resource and the secret to high performance and fulfillment: attention. </p> <p>Combining cutting-edge research with practical findings, <i>Focus</i> delves into the science of attention in all its varieties, presenting a long overdue discussion of this little-noticed and under-rated mental asset. In an era of unstoppable distractions, Goleman persuasively argues that now more than ever we must learn to sharpen focus if we are to survive in a complex world. </p> <p>Goleman boils down attention research into a threesome: inner, other, and outer focus. Drawing on rich case studies from fields as diverse as competitive sports, education, the arts, and business, he shows why high-achievers need all three kinds of focus, and explains how those who rely on smart practices - mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery, positive emotions and connections, and mental \"prosthetics\" that help them improve habits, add new skills, and sustain greatness - excel while others do not.</p>";
