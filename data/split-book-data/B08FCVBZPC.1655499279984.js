window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Psychological injuries and trauma suffered during childhood are extremely common. They lead to all sorts of addictive behaviors as well as anxiety, depression, and debilitating and life-threatening physical maladies. In <i>Healing with Psychedelics</i>, Chris writes about how to recognize the often-hidden histories that caused us as children to create a false self and changed how we operate in this world. He then takes us on his personal healing journey, revealing the details of his own experience and describing the process of psychedelic-assisted sacred-medicine therapy. It is his hope that his example will encourage others to seek and realize profound transformation for themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p>The essays are rich in first-hand accounts of Chris's spiritual experiences, meditation practices, and healing journey. The poems will sing to your heart and call to your unconscious.</p>";
