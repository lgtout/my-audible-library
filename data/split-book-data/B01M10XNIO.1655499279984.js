window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The author of the 400,000-copy best seller <i>On Killing </i>reveals how violent video games have ushered in a new era of mass homicide - and what we must do about it.</b> </p> <p><i>Paducah, Kentucky, 1997</i>: a 14-year-old boy shoots eight students in a prayer circle at his school. <i>Littleton, Colorado, 1999</i>: two high school seniors kill a teacher, 12 other students, and then themselves. <i>Utoya, Norway, 2011</i>: a political extremist shoots and kills 69 participants in a youth summer camp. <i>Newtown, Connecticut, 2012</i>: a troubled 20-year-old man kills 20 children and six adults at the elementary school he once attended. </p> <p>What links these and other horrific acts of mass murder? A young person's obsession with video games that teach to kill. </p> <p>Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, who in his perennial best seller <i>On Killing</i> revealed that most of us are not \"natural born killers\" - and who has spent decades training soldiers, police, and others who keep us secure to overcome the intrinsic human resistance to harming others and to use firearms responsibly when necessary - turns a laser focus on the threat posed to our society by violent video games. </p> <p>Drawing on crime statistics, cutting-edge social research, and scientific studies of the teenage brain, Col. Grossman shows how video games that depict antisocial, misanthropic, casually savage behavior can warp the mind - with potentially deadly results. His audiobook will become the focus of a new national conversation about video games and the epidemic of mass murders that they have unleashed. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
