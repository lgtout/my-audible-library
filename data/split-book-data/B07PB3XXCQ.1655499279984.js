window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tommy J. Curry’s provocative audiobook <i>The Man-Not </i>is a justification for Black male studies. He posits that we should conceptualize the Black male as a victim oppressed by his sex. <i>The Man-Not</i>, therefore, is a corrective of sorts, offering a concept of Black males that could challenge the existing accounts of Black men and boys desiring the power of white men who oppress them that has been proliferated throughout academic research across disciplines.</p> <p>Curry argues that Black men struggle with death and suicide, as well as abuse and rape, and their genred existence deserves study and theorization. This audiobook offers intellectual, historical, sociological, and psychological evidence that the analysis of patriarchy offered by mainstream feminism (including Black feminism) does not yet fully understand the role that homoeroticism, sexual violence, and vulnerability play in the deaths and lives of Black males. Curry challenges how we think of and perceive the conditions that actually affect all Black males.</p>";
