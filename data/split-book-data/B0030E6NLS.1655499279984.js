window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Galbraith's classic on the \"economics of abundance\" is, in the words of the <i>New York Times</i>, \"a compelling challenge to conventional thought\". With customary clarity, eloquence, and humor, Galbraith cuts to the heart of what economic security means (and doesn't mean) in today's world and lays bare the hazards of individual and societal complacence about economic inequity.</p><p>While \"affluent society\" and \"conventional wisdom\" (terms first used in this book) have entered the vernacular, the message of the book has not been so widely embraced - reason enough to rediscover <i>The Affluent Society</i>.</p>";
