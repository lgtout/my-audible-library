window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the most talked-about scholarly works of the past 50 years, Judith Butler's <i>Gender Trouble </i>is as celebrated as it is controversial. Arguing that traditional feminism is wrong to look to a natural, \"essential\" notion of the female, or indeed of sex or gender, Butler starts by questioning the category \"woman\" and continues in this vein with examinations of \"the masculine\" and \"the feminine.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>Best known however, but also most often misinterpreted, is Butler's concept of gender as a reiterated social performance rather than the expression of a prior reality. Thrilling and provocative, few other academic works have roused passions to the same extent.</p>";
