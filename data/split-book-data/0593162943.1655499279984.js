window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Based on Stanford University psychologist Kelly McGonigal's wildly popular course \"The Science of Willpower\", <i>The Willpower Instinct</i> is the first book to explain the science of self-control and how it can be harnessed to improve our health, happiness, and productivity.</p> <p>Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, <i>The Willpower Instinct</i> explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. For example, listeners will learn:</p> <ul> <li>Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health.</li> <li>Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, but the brain can be trained for greater willpower&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Guilt and shame over your setbacks lead to giving in again, but self-forgiveness and self-compassion boost self-control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Giving up control is sometimes the only way to gain self-control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Willpower failures are contagious - you can catch the desire to overspend or overeat from your friends­­ - but you can also catch self-control from the right role models.</li> </ul> <p>In the groundbreaking tradition of <i>Getting Things Done</i>, <i>The Willpower Instinct</i> combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help listeners with goals ranging from losing weight to more patient parenting, less procrastination, better health, and greater productivity at work.&nbsp;</p>";
