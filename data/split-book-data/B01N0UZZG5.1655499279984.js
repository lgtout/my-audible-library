window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the internationally best-selling author of <i>The Vegetarian</i>, a \"rare and astonishing\" (<i>The Observer</i>) portrait of political unrest and the universal struggle for justice. </b></p> <p>In the midst of a violent student uprising in South Korea, a young boy named Dong-ho is shockingly killed. </p> <p>The story of this tragic episode unfolds in a sequence of interconnected chapters as the victims and the bereaved encounter suppression, denial, and the echoing agony of the massacre. From Dong-ho's best friend who meets his own fateful end; to an editor struggling against censorship; to a prisoner and a factory worker, each suffering from traumatic memories; and to Dong-ho's own grief-stricken mother; and through their collective heartbreak and acts of hope is the tale of a brutalized people in search of a voice. </p> <p>An award-winning, controversial best seller, <i>Human Acts</i> is a timeless, pointillist portrait of an historic event with reverberations still being felt today, by turns tracing the harsh reality of oppression and the resounding, extraordinary poetry of humanity. </p> <p>Read by Sandra Oh, Greta Jung, Jae Jung, Jennifer Kim, Raymond J. Lee, and Keong Smith, with an introduction read by Deborah Smith. </p>";
