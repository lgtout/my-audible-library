Drawing upon exclusive interviews with Washington’s top policy makers, access to newly declassified documents, and her own reporting from the modern killing fields, Power provides the answer in <i>A Problem from Hell,</i> a groundbreaking work that tells the stories of the courageous Americans who risked their careers and lives in an effort to get the United States to act.</p>";
