window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Is there a hidden part of you that no one else sees? Do you have a vivid inner world of thoughts and emotions that your peers and loved ones can't seem to access? Have you ever been told you're too quiet, shy, boring, or awkward? Are your habits and comfort zones questioned by a society that doesn't seem to get you? If so, you might be an introvert. </p> <p>On behalf of those who have long been misunderstood, rejected, or ignored, fellow introvert Jenn Granneman writes a compassionate vindication - exploring, discovering, and celebrating the secret inner world of introverts. Drawing on scientific research, in-depth interviews with experts and other introverts, and her own personal story, Granneman reveals the clockwork behind the introvert's mind - and why so many people get it wrong. </p> <p>So whether you're a bona fide introvert, an extrovert anxious to learn how introverts tick, or a curious ambivert, this empowering manifesto will answer questions you've always had. </p>";
