window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From one of the most prominent voices on the American left, a galvanizing argument for why we need socialism in the United States today.</b></p> <p>The success of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign revived a political idea many had thought dead. But what exactly is socialism? And what would a socialist system in America look like?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Socialist Manifesto</i>, Bhaskar Sunkara explores socialism's history since the mid-1800s and presents a realistic vision for its future. The editor of <i>Jacobin</i> Magazine, Sunkara shows that socialism, though often seen primarily as an economic system, in fact offers the means to fight all forms of oppression, including racism and sexism. The ultimate goal is not Soviet-style planning, but to win rights to health care, education, and housing and to create new democratic institutions in workplaces and communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>A primer on socialism for the 21st century, this is an audiobook for anyone seeking an end to the vast inequities of our age.</p>";
