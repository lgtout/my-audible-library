window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The world's most dangerous book. A timeless piece that would undoubtedly disrupt the plans of any authoritarian regime. <i>The Art of Guerrilla Warfare</i> is a must-listen for anyone interested in military strategy.</p> <p>Fighting a superior foe is a momentous task. There are many ways it can be done, there are many ways victories can be achieved. In war, there are no rules, there are no laws. There are only strategies and tactics. Many say what they would do in the face of tyranny, many know what they should do when the powerful become predators.&nbsp;</p> <p>A divided people can be isolated and devoured. Survival depends upon the masses forming one mind. There is no time to weigh the importance of morality as the devil approaches. To even question any tactics that lead to victory is foolish. There is no need to ponder what the enemy deems acceptable, they occupy the opposite end of the spectrum for a reason. At war with a superior force, one has no choice but to assume the role of the guerrilla.</p>";
