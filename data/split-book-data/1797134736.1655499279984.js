window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The author of the acclaimed </b><b><i>Advice for Future Corpses (and Those Who Love Them)</i></b><b> brings “her singular sensibility, her genius for language, her love of our deeply imperfect world” (Karen Karbo, author of </b><b><i>In Praise of Difficult Women</i></b><b>) to this insightful exploration of reality TV and the shifting definitions of truth in America. </b></p> <p>What is the truth?&nbsp;</p> <p>In a world of fake news and rampant conspiracy theories, the nature of truth has increasingly blurry borders. In this clever and timely cultural commentary, award-winning author Sallie Tisdale tackles this issue by framing it in a familiar way - reality TV, particularly the long-running CBS show <i>Survivor</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>With humor and in-depth superfan analysis, Tisdale explores the distinction between suspended disbelief and true authenticity both in how we watch shows like <i>Survivor</i> and in how we perceive the world around us. With her “bold and wise, galvanizing and grounding” (Chloe Caldwell, author of <i>I’ll Tell You in Person</i>) writing, Tisdale has created an unputdownable, thoroughly entertaining, and groundbreaking book that we will be talking about for years to come.</p>";
