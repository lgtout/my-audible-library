window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1974 and the culmination of a life's work,&nbsp;<i>The Denial of Death</i> is Ernest Becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the \"why\" of human existence. In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie: man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than 30 years after its writing.</p>";
