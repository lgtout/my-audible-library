window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In his engaging audiobook, Jules Evans explains how ancient philosophy saved his life and how we can all use it to become happier, wiser and more resilient.</p> <p>Jules imagines a dream school, which includes 12 of the greatest and most colourful thinkers the world has ever known.</p> <p>Each of these ancient philosophers teaches a technique we can use to transform ourselves and live better lives. These practical techniques are illustrated by the extraordinary stories of real people who are using them today - from marines to magicians, from astronauts to anarchists and from CBT psychologists to soldiers. Jules also explores how ancient philosophy is inspiring modern communities - Socratic cafes, Stoic armies, Platonic sects, Sceptic summer camps - and even whole nations in their quest for the good life.</p>";
