window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seldom does a book have the impact of Michelle Alexander’s <i>The New Jim Crow</i>. Since it was first published in 2010, it has been cited in judicial decisions and has been adopted in campus-wide and community-wide reads; it helped inspire the creation of the Marshall Project and the new $100 million Art for Justice Fund; it has been the winner of numerous prizes, including the prestigious NAACP Image Award; and it has spent nearly 250 weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> best seller list.</p> <p>Most important of all, it has spawned a whole generation of criminal justice reform activists and organizations motivated by Michelle Alexander’s unforgettable argument that “we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it”. As the <i>Birmingham News</i> proclaimed, it is “undoubtedly the most important book published in this century about the U.S.”</p> <p>Now, 10 years after it was first published, The New Press is proud to issue a 10th-anniversary edition with a new preface by Michelle Alexander that discusses the impact the book has had and the state of the criminal justice reform movement today.&nbsp;</p>";
