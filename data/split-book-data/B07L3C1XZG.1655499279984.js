window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An updated edition of a standard in its field that remains relevant more than 20 years after its original publication.</b></p> <p>More than 20 years ago, sociologist and University of California, Berkeley, professor Arlie Hochschild set off a tidal wave of conversation and controversy with her best-selling book, <i>The Second Shift.</i> In it, she examined what really happens in dual-career households. Adding together time in paid work, child care, and housework, she found that working mothers put in a month of work a year more than their spouses. Updated for a workforce now half female, this edition cites a range of new studies and statistics and includes a new afterword in which Hochschild assesses how much - and how little - has changed for women today.</p>";
