window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Way of the Psychonaut</i> is one of the most important books ever written about the human psyche and the spiritual quest. The new understandings were made possible thanks to Albert Hofmann’s discovery of LSD - the microscope and telescope of the human psyche - as well as other psychedelic substances. This comprehensive work is a tour de force through the worlds of psychology and psychotherapy, Holotropic Breathwork, maps of the psyche, birth, sex, and death, psychospiritual rebirth, the roots of trauma, spiritual emergency and transpersonal experiences, karma and reincarnation, higher creativity, great art, and archetypes.</p> <p>Written in his late '80s, at the height of his magnificent career, <i>The Way of the Psychonaut</i> is possibly Grof’s greatest contribution. The commanding breadth and depth of his knowledge is astounding, the tone of his writing easy and accessible, and his narratives brightened with amusing anecdotes, intriguing personal accounts, and brilliant case studies. Grof reviews the history of depth psychotherapy, the important revisions that are needed to make it more effective, and why the inner quest is such an essential pursuit.</p> <p>As one of the fathers of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, its most experienced practitioner, and deeply deserving of a Nobel Prize in medicine, in these two volumes Grof has successfully unveiled a new and sweeping paradigm in self-exploration and healing. The vast and practical knowledge in this book is sure to be an invaluable and treasured resource for all serious seekers.</p> <p>Author Stanislav Grof, MD, PhD, is a psychiatrist with over 60 years of research experience in non-ordinary states of consciousness and one of the founders and chief theoreticians of transpersonal psychology.&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrator Becca Tarnas, PhD, is a scholar and artist; author of the book <i>Journey to the Imaginal Realm: A Reader’s Guide to J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings</i>; and editor of<i> Archai: The Journal of Archetypal Cosmology</i>.</p>";
