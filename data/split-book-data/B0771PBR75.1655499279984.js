window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why do we experience recurring struggles in our relationships? And why do traumatic events - such as a physical injury, emotional threat, loss of a loved one, or other life crisis - so often awaken or amplify our sense of fear, anger, isolation, or helplessness? </p> <p>From our earliest years, teaches Diane Poole Heller, we develop an attachment style that follows us through life, replaying in our intimate relationships, with our children, and at work. And traumatic events can deeply affect that core relational blueprint. </p> <p>With <i>Healing Your Attachment Wounds</i>, a pioneer in attachment theory and trauma resolution brings together these two fields to help us understand and benefit from their complementary principles and methods. </p> <p>This in-depth audio learning program sheds light on the three styles of insecure attachment - <i>Avoidant</i>, <i>Ambivalent</i>, and <i>Disorganized</i> - and the ideal fourth style of <i>Secure </i>attachment, where we enjoy a foundation of safety, adaptability, and intimacy with others. </p> <p><i>The good news is that we can change, regardless of our early or current life experiences.</i> </p> <p>\"As we heal and move toward Secure attachment,\" teaches Heller, \"we become aware of triggers and patterns in our relationships. Our nervous system learns to be more regulated. Things don't throw us off so easily. And we open our capacity to love and experience greater compassion.\" </p> <p>Through key principles, examples, and practical exercises, this program invites you to begin your own healing journey toward healthy vulnerability, wholeness, and connection with others. </p>";
