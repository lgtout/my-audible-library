window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the tradition of Octavia Butler, here is radical self-help, society-help, and planet-help to shape the futures we want. Change is constant. The world, our bodies, and our minds are in a constant state of flux. They are a stream of ever-mutating, emergent patterns. Rather than steel ourselves against such change, <i>Emergent Strategy</i> teaches us to map and assess the swirling structures and to read them as they happen, all the better to shape that which ultimately shapes us, personally and politically. A resolutely materialist spirituality based equally on science and science fiction: a wild feminist and afro-futurist ride!</p> <p>adrienne maree brown, co-editor of <i>Octavia’s Brood: Science Fiction from Social Justice Movements</i>, is a social justice facilitator, healer, and doula living in Detroit.</p>";
