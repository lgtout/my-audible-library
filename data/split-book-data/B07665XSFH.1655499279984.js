window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the man behind the popular <i>Wired</i> series \"Absurd Creature of the Week\", a fun, fascinating collection of unique animals and the unbelievable evolutionary traits they use to survive the most extreme scenarios. </p> <p><i>The Wasp That Brainwashed the Caterpillar</i> is an absurdist, comical romp through evolution's weirdest solutions to - appropriately enough - the hazards that evolution itself produces. Each original entry talks about a creature and its amazing adaptation, using Matt Simon's signature blend of scientific accuracy and humor that has made his <i>Wired</i> column and accompanying web show so popular. </p> <p>The creatures themselves are absolutely mind-blowing, with zombie ants mind-controlled by a fungus; beautiful salamanders that can regenerate any part of their bodies including their brains; the mantis shrimp, which fires its club-like appendage so fast that the surrounding water becomes as hot as the surface of the sun; the Antechinus, whose runaway testosterone levels cause them to have so much sex during their three-week mating session that they bleed internally, go blind, and drop dead; and many more. </p>";
