window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You have the opportunity to lead: to show up with confidence, connected to others, and committed to a purpose in a way that inspires others to follow. Maybe it's in your workplace, or in your relationships, or simply in your own life. But great leadership - leadership that aligns teams, inspires action, and achieves results - is hard. And what makes it hard isn't theoretical, it's practical. It's not about knowing what to say or do. It's about whether you're willing to experience the discomfort, risk, and uncertainty of saying or doing it. In other words, the most critical challenge of leadership is emotional courage. If you are willing to feel everything, you can do anything.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Leading with Emotional Courage</i>, based on the author's popular blogs for <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, provides practical, real-world advice for building your emotional courage muscle. Each short, accessible chapter details a distinct step in this emotional \"workout\", giving you grounded advice for handling the difficult situations without sacrificing professional ground. By building the courage to say the necessary but difficult things, you become a stronger leader and leave the \"should'ves\" behind.</p>";
