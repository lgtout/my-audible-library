window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine living in a world in which you were routinely patronized by women.</p> <p>Imagine having your views ignored or your expertise frequently challenged by them.</p> <p>Imagine people always addressing the woman you are with before you.</p> <p>Now imagine a world in which the reverse of this is true.</p> <p><i>The Authority Gap </i>provides a startling perspective on the unseen bias at work in our everyday lives, to reveal the scale of the gap that still persists between men and women. Would you believe that female US Supreme Court Justices are interrupted four times more often than male ones...96 percent of the time by men? Or that British parents, when asked to estimate their child's IQ, will place their son at 115 and their daughter at 107?</p> <p>Marshalling a wealth of data with precision and insight, and including interviews with pioneering women such as Baroness Hale, Mary Beard, and Bernadine Evaristo, Mary Ann Sieghart exposes unconscious bias in this fresh, feminist take on how to address and counteract systemic sexism in ways that benefit us all.</p>";
