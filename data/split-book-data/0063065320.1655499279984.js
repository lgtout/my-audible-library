A few governments proved adept at handling the crisis while many others failed. Are Western governments healthy and strong enough to keep their citizens safe from another virulent virus—and protect their economies from collapse? Is global leadership passing from the United States to Asia—and particularly China?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Wake-Up Call </i>addresses these urgent questions. Journalists and longtime collaborators John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge identify the problems Western leaders face, and outline a detailed plan to help them become more vigilant, better prepared, and responsive to disruptive future events.&nbsp;</p> <p>The problems that face us are enormous; as <i>The Wake-Up Call</i> makes clear, governments around the world must re-engineer the way they operate to successfully meet the challenges ahead.&nbsp;</p>";
