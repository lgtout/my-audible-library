window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Reconnect with your wild essence as you awaken your innate bond with the natural world.</b></p> <p>\"<i>Rewilding </i>is a return to our essential nature. It is an attempt to reclaim something of what we were before we used words like 'civilized' to define ourselves.\" (Micah Mortali)</p> <p>In his long-awaited book, <i>Rewilding</i>, Kripalu director Micah Mortali brings together yoga, mindfulness, wilderness training, and ancestral skills to create a unique guide for reigniting your primal energy - your undomesticated true self - and deepening your connection with the living earth.</p> <p>For hundreds of thousands of years, humans lived intimately with the earth. We were in the wild and of the wild. Today, we live mostly urban lives - and our vital wildness has gone dormant. As a result, we're more isolated, unhealthy, anxious, and depressed than ever, and our planet has suffered alongside us.</p> <p>With <i>Rewilding</i>, Mortali invites us to shed the effects of over-civilization and explore an inner wisdom that is primal, ancient, and profound. Whether you live in the middle of a city or alongside the woods, the insights and practices in this audiobook will bring you home to your wild, wise, and alive self.</p>";
