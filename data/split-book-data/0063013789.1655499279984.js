window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A psychiatrist and psychedelic researcher explores the science of connection - why we need it, how we’ve lost it, and how we might find it again.</b></p> <p>We are suffering from an epidemic of disconnection that antidepressants and social media can’t fix. This state of isolation puts us in \"fight or flight mode\", deranging sleep, metabolism, and libido. What’s worse, we’re paranoid of others. This kill-or-be-killed framework is not a way to live. But when we feel safe and loved, we can rest, digest, and repair. We can heal. And it is only in this state of belonging that we can open up to connection with others.</p> <p>In this powerful audiobook, Holland helps us to understand the science of connection as revealed in human experiences from the spiritual to the psychedelic. The key is oxytocin - a neurotransmitter and hormone produced in our bodies that allows us to trust and bond. It fosters attachment between mothers and infants, romantic partners, friends, and even with our pets. There are many ways to reach this state of mental and physical well-being that modern medicine has overlooked. The implications for our happiness and health are profound.</p> <p>We can find oneness in meditation, in community, or in awe at the beauty around us. Another option: psychedelic medicines that can catalyze a connection with the self, with nature, or the cosmos.&nbsp;<i>Good Chemistry</i>&nbsp;points us on the right path to forging true and deeper attachments with our own souls, to one another, and even to our planet, helping us heal ourselves and our world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
