window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Adyashanti asks us to let go of our struggles with life and open to the full promise of spiritual awakening: the end of delusion and the discovery and expression of our essential being. After 15 years as a spiritual teacher, Adyashanti has found that the simpler the teaching, the greater its power to initiate this awakening.</p> <p>On <i>Falling into Grace,</i> he shares what he considers fundamental insights to \"open ourselves to that mysterious element that enters in the hidden and quiet moments and sparks a revolution in the way that we perceive life.\" Wherever you may be on your own spiritual path, you will find in these sessions down-to-earth guidance on breaking the trance of ego, experiencing the raw energy of emotion, cultivating inner stability, transcending the world of opposites, and more.</p> <p>In the same way that we fall into the arms of a loved one or drop our heads on the pillow at night, we can surrender into the beauty and truth of who and what we really are. <i>Falling into Grace</i> is a program that gets to the core of why we suffer, and allows us to explore Adyashanti's invitation \"to be taken by a moment of grace and fall into a sense of life when it is not separate from you, when life is actually an expression of something indefinable, mysterious, and immense.\"</p> <p>Highlights:</p> <ul> <li>The human dilemma - the concept of a separate self and the choice to stop believing the thoughts that perpetuate suffering</li> <li>“Taking the backward step” into the pure potential of the present moment</li> <li>Why spiritual awakening can be a disturbing process</li> <li>Intimacy and availability - feeling absolute union with every part of our experience</li> <li>True autonomy - the unique expression of our own sense of freedom</li> </ul> <p></p>";
