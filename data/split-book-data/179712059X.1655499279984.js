window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From social psychologist Dr. Devon Price, a conversational, stirring call to “a better, more human way to live” (Cal Newport, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author) that examines the “laziness lie” - which falsely tells us we are not working or learning hard enough.</b></p> <p>Extra-curricular activities. Honors classes. 60-hour work weeks. Side hustles.</p> <p>Like many Americans, Dr. Devon Price believed that productivity was the best way to measure self-worth. Price was an overachiever from the start, graduating from both college and graduate school early, but that success came at a cost. After Price was diagnosed with a severe case of anemia and heart complications from overexertion, they were forced to examine the darker side of all this productivity.</p> <p><i>Laziness Does Not Exist </i>explores the psychological underpinnings of the “laziness lie,” including its origins from the Puritans and how it has continued to proliferate as digital work tools have blurred the boundaries between work and life. Using in-depth research, Price explains that people today do far more work than nearly any other humans in history, yet most of us often still feel we are not doing enough.</p> <p>Filled with practical and accessible advice for overcoming society’s pressure to do more, and featuring interviews with researchers, consultants, and experiences from real people drowning in too much work, <i>Laziness Does Not Exist</i> “is the book we all need right now” (Caroline Dooner, author of <i>The F*ck It Diet</i>).</p>";
