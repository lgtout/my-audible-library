But so many routes are closed, and so much money is needed. Then one night in Lisbon, as a poor young refugee gazes hungrily at a boat bound for America, a stranger approaches him with two tickets and a story to tell.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a harrowing tale of bravery and butchery, daring and death, in which the price of love is beyond measure, and the legacy of evil is infinite. As the refugee listens spellbound to the desperate teller, in a matter of hours, the two form a unique and unshakable bond - one that will last all their lives.</p>";
