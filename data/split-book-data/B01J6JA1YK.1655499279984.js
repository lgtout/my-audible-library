All too often, our natural talents go untapped. From the cradle to the cubicle, we devote more time to fixing our shortcomings than to developing our strengths.&nbsp;</p> <p>To help people uncover their talents, Gallup introduced the first version of its online assessment, StrengthsFinder, in the 2001 management book <i>Now, Discover Your Strengths</i>. The book spent more than five years on the bestseller lists and ignited a global conversation, while StrengthsFinder helped millions discover their top five talents.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>StrengthsFinder 2.0</i>, Gallup unveils the <i>new and improved</i> version of its popular assessment, language of 34 themes, and much more. While you can listen to this book in one sitting, you'll use it as a reference for decades.&nbsp;</p> <p>Loaded with hundreds of strategies for applying your strengths, this new book and accompanying website will change the way you look at yourself - and the world around you - forever.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, you will be emailed a unique ID that provides access to accompanying online material.</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
