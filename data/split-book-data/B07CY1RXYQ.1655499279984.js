window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Mary Roach meets Bill Bryson in this \"surefire summer winner\" (Janet Maslin, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>), an uproarious tour of the basest instincts and biggest mysteries of the animal world </b></p> <p>Humans have gone to the Moon and discovered the Higgs boson, but when it comes to understanding animals, we've still got a long way to go. Whether we're seeing a viral video of romping baby pandas or a picture of penguins \"holding hands,\" it's hard for us not to project our own values - innocence, fidelity, temperance, hard work - onto animals. So you've probably never considered if moose get drunk, penguins cheat on their mates, or worker ants lay about. They do - and that's just for starters.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Truth About Animals</i>, Lucy Cooke takes us on a worldwide journey to meet everyone from a Colombian hippo castrator to a Chinese panda porn peddler, all to lay bare the secret - and often hilarious - habits of the animal kingdom. Charming and at times downright weird, this modern bestiary is perfect for anyone who has ever suspected that virtue might be unnatural.&nbsp;</p>";
