window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For centuries, experts have argued that learning was about memorizing information: You're supposed to study facts, dates, and details, burn them into your memory, and then apply that knowledge at opportune times. But this approach to learning isn't nearly enough for the world that we live in today, and in <i>Learn Better</i> journalist and education researcher Ulrich Boser demonstrates that how we learn can matter just as much as what we learn. </p> <p>In this brilliantly researched book, Boser maps out the new science of learning, showing how simple techniques like comprehension check-ins and making material personally relatable can help people gain expertise in dramatically better ways. He covers six key steps to help listeners \"learn how to learn,\" all illuminated with fascinating stories like how Jackson Pollock developed his unique painting style and why an ancient Japanese counting device allows kids to do math at superhuman speeds. Boser's witty, engaging writing makes this book feel like a guilty pleasure, not homework. </p> <p><i>Learn Better</i> will revolutionize the way students and society alike approach learning and makes the case that being smart is not an innate ability - learning is a skill everyone can master. With Boser as their guide, listeners will be able to fully capitalize on their brain's remarkable ability to gain new skills and open up a whole new world of possibilities. </p>";
