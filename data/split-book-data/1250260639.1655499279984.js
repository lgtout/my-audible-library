window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"[Oprah Winfrey and Bruce D. Perry] are both capable, likable narrators who are sincerely engaged with their subject matter...The performances of these two humanitarians make this a must-hear for anyone recovering from their traumatic past.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b>)</b><br> <br> <b>This program is read by the authors.</b><br> <br> <b>Our earliest experiences shape our lives far down the road, and </b><b><i>What Happened to You?</i></b><b> provides powerful scientific and emotional insights into the behavioral patterns so many of us struggle to understand.</b></p> <p><i>“Through this lens we can build a renewed sense of personal self-worth and ultimately recalibrate our responses to circumstances, situations, and relationships. It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very lives.\"</i> (Oprah Winfrey)</p> <p><b>This audiobook is going to change the way you see your life.</b><br> <br> Have you ever wondered \"Why did I do that?\" or \"Why can't I <i>just</i> control my behavior?\" Others may judge our reactions and think, \"What's wrong with that person?\" When questioning our emotions, it's easy to place the blame on ourselves; holding ourselves and those around us to an impossible standard. It's time we started asking a different question.<br> <br> Through deeply personal conversations, Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain and trauma expert Dr. Bruce Perry offer a groundbreaking and profound shift from asking “What’s wrong with you?” to “What happened to you?”<br> <br> Here, Winfrey shares stories from her own past, understanding through experience the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma and adversity at a young age. In conversation throughout the audiobook, she and Dr. Perry focus on understanding people, behavior, and ourselves. It’s a subtle but profound shift in our approach to trauma, and it’s one that allows us to understand our pasts in order to clear a path to our future - opening the door to resilience and healing in a proven, powerful way.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books</b></p>";
