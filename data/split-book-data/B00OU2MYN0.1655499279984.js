window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A brilliant, no-nonsense profile of the criminal mind, newly updated to include new influences, effective methods for dealing with hardened criminals,&nbsp;and a call to rethink criminal justice reform&nbsp;from expert witness Dr. Stanton E. Samenow.</p> <p>Long-held myths defining the sources of and cures for crime are shattered in this groundbreaking audiobook - and a chilling profile of today's criminal emerges. In 1984, Stanton Samenow changed the way we think about the&nbsp;workings of the criminal mind with a revolutionary approach to \"habilitation\". In 2014, armed with 40 years of additional knowledge and insight, Samenow explored the subject anew, using his vast expertise to explain the thought patterns of those who commit the crimes we were most concerned with in the new millennium, such as domestic violence, Internet victimization, and terrorism.</p> <p>The fields of criminal behavior have expanded, demanding another updated version, which includes an exploration of computers as a vehicle for criminal conduct; new drugs, pharmaceutical influences, and the impact of the opioid crisis; exposure to the rawest forms of violence in video games, films, and television broadcasts; social media as an arena for illicit activities; updated genetic and biological research into whether some people are \"wired\" to become criminals; and new research on criminal justice reform. Throughout, we learn from Samenow's five decades of experience how truly vital it is to know who the criminal is and how he or she thinks differently. Only once equipped with that crucial understanding can we reach reasonable, compassionate, and effective solutions.</p>";
