window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>First published in 1998, <i>Following Through</i> shines a spotlight into the black hole in inner space where good intentions disappear. It reveals the startling reason why we so often fail to make the life-improving changes we truly intend to make. </p> <p>Although we typically blame ourselves for poor follow through - we beat ourselves up for lacking motivation, willpower, self-discipline - Levinson and Greider argue that the real culprit is the mixed-up way the human mind is designed. The mind, they insist, simply isn't hard-wired for follow-through. And as much as we - individuals, society, and especially the self-improvement industry - like to pretend otherwise, good intentions don't automatically drive our behavior. And expecting ourselves to automatically do whatever we intend to do only leads to disappointment, frustration, and failure. </p> <p>Fortunately, <i>Following Through</i> won't leave you discouraged. It'll show you why facing the truth about the mind's faulty wiring is a key to achieving greater success in virtually every area of life. <i>Following Through</i> will teach you bold new strategies for consistently turning good intentions into life-improving action. </p>";
