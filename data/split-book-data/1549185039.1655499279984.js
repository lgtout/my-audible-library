window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The preeminent doctor and bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel is repeatedly asked one question: Which country has the best health care? He set off to find an answer.</b></p> <p>The US spends more than any other nation, nearly four trillion dollars, on health care. Yet, for all that expense, the US is not ranked number one - not even close.</p> <p>In <i>Which Country Has the World's Best Healthcare?</i> Ezekiel Emanuel profiles 11 of the world's health-care systems in pursuit of the best or at least where excellence can be found. Using a unique comparative structure, the book allows health-care professionals, patients, and policymakers alike to know which systems perform well, and why, and which face endemic problems. From Taiwan to Germany, Australia to Switzerland, the most inventive health-care providers tackle a global set of challenges - in pursuit of the best health care in the world.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
