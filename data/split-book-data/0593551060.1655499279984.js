window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An extraordinary history of resistance and the fight for Indian independence -</b> <b>the little-known story of seven foreigners to India who joined the movement fighting for freedom from British colonial rule. </b></p> <p><i>Rebels Against the Raj</i> tells the little-known story of seven people who chose to struggle for a country other than their own: foreigners to India who, across the late 19th to late 20th century, arrived to join the freedom movement fighting for independence from British colonial rule.</p> <p>Of the seven, four were British, two American, and one Irish. Four men, three women. Before and after being jailed or deported, they did remarkable and pioneering work in a variety of fields: journalism, social reform, education, the emancipation of women, environmentalism.</p> <p>This book tells their stories, each renegade motivated by idealism and genuine sacrifice; each connected to Gandhi, though some as acolytes where others found endless infuriation in his views; each understanding they would likely face prison sentences for their resistance, and likely live and die in India; each one leaving a profound impact on the region in which they worked, their legacies continuing through the institutions they founded and the generations and individuals they inspired.</p> <p>Through these entwined lives, wonderfully told by one of the world’s finest historians, we reach deep insights into relations between India and the West, and India’s story as a country searching for its identity and liberty beyond British colonial rule.</p>";
