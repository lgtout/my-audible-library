window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The biggest problem in American health care is us.</p> <p>Do you know how to tell good health care from bad health care? Guess again. As patients, we wrongly assume the \"best\" care is dependent mainly on the newest medications, the most complex treatments, and the smartest doctors. But Americans look for health-care solutions in the wrong places. For example, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved each year if doctors reduced common errors and maximized preventive medicine.</p> <p>For Dr. Robert Pearl, these kinds of mistakes are a matter of professional importance, but also personal significance: He lost his own father due in part to poor communication and treatment planning by doctors. And consumers make costly mistakes too: We demand modern information technology from our banks, airlines, and retailers, but we passively accept last century's technology in our health care.</p> <p>Solving the challenges of health care starts with understanding these problems. <i>Mistreated</i> explains why subconscious misperceptions are so common in medicine, and shows how modifying the structure, technology, financing, and leadership of American health care could radically improve quality outcomes. This important audiobook proves we can overcome our fears and faulty assumptions, and provides a road map for a better, healthier future.</p>";
