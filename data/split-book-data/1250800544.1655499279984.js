With the same open-hearted generosity that has made his video series a phenomenon, Acho explains the vital core of such fraught concepts as white privilege, cultural appropriation, and “reverse racism.” In his own words, he provides a space of compassion and understanding in a discussion that can lack both. He asks only for the listener’s curiosity—but along the way, he will galvanize all of us to join the antiracist fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Flatiron Books </b></p>";
