window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Families today are squeezed on every side - from high childcare costs and harsh employment policies to workplaces without paid family leave or even dependable and regular working hours. Many realize that attaining the standard of living their parents managed has become impossible.</p> <p>Alissa Quart, executive editor of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, examines the lives of many middle-class Americans who can now barely afford to raise children. Through gripping firsthand storytelling, Quart shows how our country has failed its families. Her subjects - from professors to lawyers to caregivers to nurses - have been wrung out by a system that doesnâ€™t support them and enriches only a tiny elite.</p> <p>Interlacing her own experience with close-up reporting on families that are just getting by, Quart reveals parenthood itself to be financially overwhelming, except for the wealthiest. She offers real solutions to these problems, including outlining necessary policy shifts, as well as detailing the DIY tactics some families are already putting into motion and argues for the cultural reevaluation of parenthood and caregiving.&nbsp;</p> <p>Written in the spirit of Barbara Ehrenreich and Jennifer Senior,<i> Squeezed</i>&nbsp;is an eye-opening audiobook. Powerfully argued, deeply reported, and ultimately hopeful,&nbsp;it&nbsp;casts a bright, clarifying light on families struggling to thrive in an economy that holds too few options. It will make listeners think differently about their lives and those of their neighbors.</p>";
