window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here is a concise, comprehensive overview of Wilber's revolutionary thought and its application in today's world. In <i>A Theory of Everything</i>, Wilber uses clear, nontechnical language to present complex, cutting-edge theories that integrate the realms of body, mind, soul, and spirit. He then demonstrates how these theories and models can be applied to real-world problems in areas such as politics, medicine, business, education, and the environment. Wilber also discusses daily practices that readers take up in order to apply this integrative vision to their own everyday lives.</p>";
