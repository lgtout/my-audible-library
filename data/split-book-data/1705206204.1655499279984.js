window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this characteristically turbocharged new book, celebrated <i>Rolling Stone</i> journalist Matt Taibbi provides an insider's guide to the variety of ways today's mainstream media tells us lies. Part tirade, part confessional, it reveals that what most people think of as \"the news\" is, in fact, a twisted wing of the entertainment business.</p> <p>In the internet age, the press have mastered the art of monetizing anger, paranoia, and distrust. Taibbi, who has spent much of his career covering elections in which this kind of manipulative activity is most egregious, provides a rich taxonomic survey of American political journalism's dirty tricks.</p> <p><i>Hate Inc.</i> will be an invaluable antidote to the hidden poisons dished up by those we rely on to tell us what is happening in the world.</p>";
