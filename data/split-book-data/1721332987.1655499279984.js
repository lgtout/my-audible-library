window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Learn the secret to total, lifelong health: the teeming world of microbes inside and all around us </b></p> <p>Modern-day science has allowed us to prolong and improve life in astonishing ways, often by fending off germs and other invisible foes. But there’s no “immunity” to the inevitable signs of aging...or is there?&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Whole-Body Microbiome</i>, the father-daughter team of Dr. Brett Finlay (a microbiologist) and Dr. Jessica Finlay (a specialist on aging) offers a different - and truly revolutionary - solution to the quest for the fountain of youth. While much has been written about bacteria in the gut, exciting new research shows that there are millions of microbes both <i>inside </i>our bodies - supporting our brain, teeth, heart, lungs, bones, immune system, and more; plus the microbes <i>on </i>our bodies, coming from the air we breathe and the things we touch all day long - cell phones and kitchen sponges, pets and doorknobs, and even other humans. These microbial “lifelong companions” have an immense impact on our daily health - and, as groundbreaking research is showing, they have the power to help prevent and reverse the most common age-related diseases.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this eye-opening new take on the significance of the microbiome, the Finlays offer empowering knowledge, surprising myth-busters, and simple yet effective daily tips that prove “dirty” is the new clean. Whether it’s by changing your diet, enjoying a glass of wine, getting more exercise, trading your antibacterial gel for good old soap and water, or spending more time outdoors, you can change your life today; so that you <i>and </i>your microbes live long - and prosper.</p>";
