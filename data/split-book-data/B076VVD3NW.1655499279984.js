Glenn Beck says we've been ruined by \"participation trophies\". Simon Sinek says we have low self-esteem. An Australian millionaire says millennials could all afford homes if we'd just give up avocado toast. Thanks, millionaire. </b> </i></p> <p><i><b>This millennial is here to prove them all wrong.</b> </i></p> <p><i><b>\"The best, most comprehensive work of social and economic analysis about our benighted generation.\" </b>(Tony Tulathimutte, author of <i>Private Citizens</i>) </i></p> <p><i><b>\"The kind of brilliantly simple idea that instantly clarifies an entire area of culture.\"(William Deresiewicz, author of <i>Excellent Sheep</i>) </b> </i></p> <p><i>Millennials have been stereotyped as lazy, entitled, narcissistic, and immature. We've gotten so used to sloppy generational analysis filled with dumb clich√©s about young people that we've lost sight of what <i>really</i> unites millennials. Namely: </i></p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>We are the most educated and hardworking generation in American history. </i></li> <li><i>We poured historic and insane amounts of time and money into preparing ourselves for the 21st century labor market. </i></li> <li><i>We have been taught to consider working for free (homework, internships) a privilege for our own benefit. </i></li> <li><i>We are poorer, more medicated, and more precariously employed than our parents, grandparents, even our great-grandparents, with less of a social safety net to boot. </i></li> </ul> <p></p> <p><i><i>Kids These Days</i> is about why. In brilliant, crackling prose, early Wall Street occupier Malcolm Harris gets mercilessly real about our maligned birth cohort. Examining trends like runaway student debt, the rise of the intern, mass incarceration, social media, and more, Harris gives us a portrait of what it means to be young in America today that will wake you up and piss you off. </i></p> <p><i>Millennials were the first generation raised explicitly as investments, Harris argues, and in <i>Kids These Days</i>, he dares us to confront and take charge of the consequences now that we are grown up. </i></p>";
