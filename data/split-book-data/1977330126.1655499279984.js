window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In<i> Before and After Loss</i>, Dr. Lisa M. Shulman, a neurologist, describes a personal story of loss and her journey to understand the science behind the mind-altering experience of grief. Part memoir, part creative nonfiction, part account of scientific discovery, this moving book combines Shulman's perspectives as an expert in brain science and a keen observer of behavior with her experience as a clinician, a caregiver, and a widow.</p> <p>Shedding light on the disconnect between conventional wisdom about loss and emerging knowledge on the neuroscience of emotional trauma as the cause of brain injury, Shulman explores not only the experience but also the science and psychology of loss. Drawing on the latest studies about grief and its effects, she explains what scientists know about how the mind, brain, and body respond and heal following traumatic loss. She also traces the interface between the experience of profound loss and the search for emotional restoration.</p>";
