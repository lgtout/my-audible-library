window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"An extraordinarily powerful journey that is both political and personal.... An important book for everyone in America to read.\" (Walter Isaacson, number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Leonardo Da Vinci</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Steve Jobs)</i></b></p> <p><b>The New Orleans mayor who removed the Confederate statues confronts the racism that shapes us and argues for white America to reckon with its past. A passionate, personal, urgent audiobook from the man who sparked a national debate.</b></p> <p>\"There is a difference between remembrance of history and reverence for it.\" When Mitch Landrieu addressed the people of New Orleans in May 2017 about his decision to take down four Confederate monuments, including the statue of Robert E. Lee, he struck a nerve nationally, and his speech has now been heard or seen by millions across the country. In his first book, Mayor Landrieu discusses his personal journey on race as well as the path he took to making the decision to remove the monuments, tackles the broader history of slavery, race and institutional inequities that still bedevil America, and traces his personal relationship to this history. His father, as state legislator and mayor, was a huge force in the integration of New Orleans in the 1960s and 1970s. Landrieu grew up with a progressive education in one of the nation's most racially divided cities, but even he had to relearn Southern history as it really happened.</p> <p>Equal parts unblinking memoir, history, and prescription for finally confronting America's most painful legacy,<i> In the Shadow of Statues </i>will contribute strongly to the national conversation about race in the age of Donald Trump, at a time when racism is resurgent with seemingly tacit approval from the highest levels of government and when too many Americans have a misplaced nostalgia for a time and place that never existed.</p>";
