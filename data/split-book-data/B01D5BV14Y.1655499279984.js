Why do many successful corporations have a chief happiness officer? What can the chemical composition of your brain tell a potential employer about you? </p> <p>In the past decade, governments and corporations have become increasingly interested in measuring the way people feel: the Happiness index, Gross National Happiness, well-being and positive psychology have come to dominate the way we live our lives. As a result, our emotions have become a new resource to be bought and sold. </p> <p>In a fascinating investigation combining history, science and ideas, William Davies shows how well-being influences all aspects of our lives: business, finance, marketing and smart technology. </p> <p>This audiobook will make you rethink everything from the way you work, the power of the Nudge, the ever-expanding definitions of depression, and the commercialization of your most private feelings. <i>The Happiness Industry</i> is a shocking and brilliantly argued warning about the new religion of the age: our emotions.</p>";
