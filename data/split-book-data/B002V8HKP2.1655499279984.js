window.bookSummaryJSON = "The Buddha said many times that just as the great oceans have but one taste, so do all the true teachings of the dharma: the taste of freedom. Jack Kornfield's <i>The Roots of Buddhist Psychology</i> opens this eternal view of the mind for all listeners. <p> Among the world's great religions, Buddhism has developed a rich psychology based not on metaphysics, but on the human predicament. Through its strategies, you can discover for yourself how to find true freedom from worldly suffering. Buddhism views the mind as a maze of feelings, perceptions, and emotional states. Unhappiness is rooted in unskillful responses to our world: grasping when things are pleasant, aversion when they are unpleasant, and delusion/confusion when they are neutral. Through awareness training, Kornfield teaches, you can transform these responses into real skills that are the path to awakening and freedom.</p> <p> Like no other teaching course, <i>The Roots of Buddhist Psychology</i> gives you immediate strategies for living in the present, including 12 profound lectures, each one a gem of intelligent wisdom, on Buddhism's central teachings about the psyche and sacred attention. Here is specific instruction, taught in the classic tradition and enlivened with many parables, worldly stories, and thoughts from artists, philosophers, and writers who have helped us see how to live true, useful lives. Join Jack Kornfield and discover for yourself that what you seek is already here.</p>";
