window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Unraveling trauma in the body, brain, and mind - a revolution in treatment. </p> <p>In this culmination of his life's work, Peter A. Levine draws on his broad experience as a clinician, a student of comparative brain research, a stress scientist, and a keen observer of the naturalistic animal world to explain the nature and transformation of trauma in the body, brain, and psyche. <i>In an Unspoken Voice</i> is based on the idea that trauma is neither a disease nor a disorder but rather an injury caused by fright, helplessness, and loss that can be healed by engaging our innate capacity to self-regulate high states of arousal and intense emotions. Enriched with a coherent theoretical framework and compelling case examples, the book elegantly blends the latest findings in biology, neuroscience, and body-oriented psychotherapy to show that when we bring together animal instinct and reason, we can become more whole human beings. </p>";
