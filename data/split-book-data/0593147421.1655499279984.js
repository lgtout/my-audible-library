window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Should we believe in God? In this brisk introduction to modern atheism, one of the world’s greatest science writers tells us why we shouldn’t.</b></p> <p><i>Richard Dawkins was 15 when he stopped believing in God.</i></p> <p>Deeply impressed by the beauty and complexity of living things, he’d felt certain they must have had a designer. Learning about evolution changed his mind. Now one of the world’s best and best-selling science communicators, Dawkins has given listeners, young and old, the same opportunity to rethink the big questions.</p> <p>In 12 fiercely funny, mind-expanding chapters, Dawkins explains how the natural world arose without a designer - the improbability and beauty of the \"bottom-up programming\" that engineers an embryo or a flock of starlings - and challenges head-on some of the most basic assumptions made by the world’s religions:&nbsp;Do you believe in God? Which one? Is the Bible a \"Good Book\"? Is adhering to a religion necessary, or even likely, to make people good to one another? Dissecting everything from Abraham’s abuse of Isaac to the construction of a snowflake, <i>Outgrowing God</i> is a concise, provocative guide to thinking for yourself.</p> <p>Includes a bonus PDF of photographs and charts.</p> <p><b>Advance praise for </b><b><i>Outgrowing God</i></b></p> <p>\"My son came home from his first day in the sixth grade with arms outstretched plaintively demanding to know: 'Have you ever heard of Jesus?'&nbsp;We burst out laughing. Maybe not our finest parenting moment, given that he was genuinely distraught. He felt that he had woken up one day to a world in which his peers were expressing beliefs he found frighteningly unreasonable. He began devouring books like&nbsp;<i>The God Delusion</i>, books that helped him formulate his own arguments and helped him stand his ground<i>.&nbsp;</i>Dawkins’s new book is special in the terrain of atheists’ pleas for humanism and rationalism precisely since it speaks to those most vulnerable to the coercive tactics of religion.&nbsp;As Dawkins himself says in the dedication, this book is for ‘all young people when they’re old enough to decide for themselves.’ It is also, I must add, for their parents.\" (Janna Levin,&nbsp;author of <i>Black Hole Blues</i>)</p> <p>\"When someone is considering atheism I tell them to read the Bible first and then Dawkins. <i>Outgrowing God</i> - second only to the Bible!\" (Penn Jillette,&nbsp;author of <i>God, No!</i>)</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
