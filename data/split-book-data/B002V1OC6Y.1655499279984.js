window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What are our obligations to others as people in a free society? Should government tax the rich to help the poor? Is the free market fair? Is it sometimes wrong to tell the truth? Is killing sometimes morally required? Is it possible, or desirable, to legislate morality? Do individual rights and the common good conflict?&nbsp;</p> <p>These questions are at the core of our public life today - and at the heart of <i>Justice</i>, in which Michael J. Sandel shows how a surer grasp of philosophy can help us to make sense of politics, morality, and our own convictions as well.</p> <p>Sandel's legendary Justice course is one of the most popular and influential at Harvard. Up to a thousand students pack the campus theater to hear Sandel relate the big questions of political philosophy to the most vexing issues of the day. In the fall of 2009, PBS will air a series based on the course.</p> <p><i>Justice</i> offers listeners the same exhilarating journey that captivates Harvard students - the challenge of thinking our way through the hard moral challenges we confront as citizens. It is a searching, lyrical exploration of the meaning of justice, an audiobook that invites listeners of all political persuasions to consider familiar controversies in fresh and illuminating ways.&nbsp;</p> <p>Affirmative action, same-sex marriage, physician-assisted suicide, abortion, national service, the moral limits of markets, patriotism, and dissent - Sandel shows how even the most hotly contested issues can be illuminated by reasoned moral argument.</p> <p><i>Justice </i>is lively, thought-provoking, and wise - an essential new addition to the small collection of works that speak convincingly to the big questions of our civic life.</p>";
