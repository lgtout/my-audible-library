window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bloomsbury presents </b><b><i>Economics: The User's Guide</i></b><b> by Ha-Joon Chang, read by Jonathan Keeble.</b></p> <p>From the internationally best-selling author and prize-winning economist - a highly original guide to the global economy.</p> <p>In his best-selling <i>23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism</i>, Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang brilliantly debunked many of the predominant myths of neoclassical economics. Now, in an entertaining and accessible primer, he explains how the global economy actually works - in real-world terms. Writing with irreverent wit, a deep knowledge of history and a disregard for conventional economic pieties, Chang offers insights that will never be found in the textbooks.</p> <p>Unlike many economists, who present only one view of their discipline, Chang introduces a wide range of economic theories, from classical to Keynesian, revealing how each has its strengths and weaknesses, and why there is no one way to explain economic behaviour. Instead, by ignoring the received wisdom and exposing the myriad forces that shape our financial world, Chang gives us the tools we need to understand our increasingly global and interconnected world often driven by economics. From the future of the euro, inequality in China, or the condition of the American manufacturing industry here in the United States - <i>Economics: The User’s Guide</i> is a concise and expertly crafted guide to economic fundamentals that offers a clear and accurate picture of the global economy and how and why it affects our daily lives.</p>";
