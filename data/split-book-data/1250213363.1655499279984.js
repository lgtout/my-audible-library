window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b></p> <p><b>Twenty years after this celebrated work of narrative nonfiction won the National Book Award and changed the American conversation about race,</b><b><i> Slaves in the Family</i></b><b> makes its audio debut, with a new preface by the author.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Ball family hails from South Carolina - Charleston and thereabouts. Their plantations were among the oldest and longest-standing plantations in the South. Between 1698 and 1865, close to 4,000 Black people were born into slavery under the Balls or were bought by them.</p> <p>In <i>Slaves in the Family, </i>Edward Ball recounts his efforts to track down and meet the descendants of his family's slaves. Part historical narrative, part oral history, part personal story of investigation and catharsis, <i>Slaves in the Family</i> is, in the words of Pat Conroy, \"a work of breathtaking generosity and courage, a magnificent study of the complexity and strangeness and beauty of the word ‘family.'\"&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
