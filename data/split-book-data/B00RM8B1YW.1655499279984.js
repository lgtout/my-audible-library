window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An unprecedented international publishing event: the first and only diary written by a still-imprisoned Guant치namo detainee.</b> </p> <p>Since 2002, Mohamedou Slahi has been imprisoned at the detention camp at Guant치namo Bay, Cuba. In all these years, the United States has never charged him with a crime. A federal judge ordered his release in March 2010, but the U.S. government fought that decision, and there is no sign that the United States plans to let him go. </p> <p>Three years into his captivity Slahi began a diary, recounting his life before he disappeared into U.S. custody, \"his endless world tour\" of imprisonment and interrogation, and his daily life as a Guant치namo prisoner. His diary is not merely a vivid record of a miscarriage of justice, but a deeply personal memoir - terrifying, darkly humorous, and surprisingly gracious. Published now for the first time, <i>Guant치namo Diary</i> is a document of immense historical importance and a riveting and profoundly revealing listen.</p>";
