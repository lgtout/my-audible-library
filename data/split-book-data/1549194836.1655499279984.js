window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>We all now live in a paranoid and polarized world of Putin's making, and the Russian leader, through guile and disruption, has resurrected Russia's status as a force with which to be reckoned. From renowned foreign policy expert Angela Stent comes a must-hear dissection of present-day Russian motives on the global stage.</b></p> <p>How did Russia manage to emerge resurgent on the world stage and play a weak hand so effectively? Is it because Putin is a brilliant strategist? Or has Russia stepped into a vacuum created by the West's distraction with its own domestic problems and US ambivalence about whether it still wants to act as a superpower? <i>Putin's World</i> examines the country's turbulent past, how it has influenced Putin, the Russians' understanding of their position on the global stage and their future ambitions - and their conviction that the West has tried to deny them a seat at the table of great powers since the USSR collapsed.</p> <p>This audiobook looks at Russia's key relationships - its downward spiral with the US, Europe, and NATO; its ties to China, Japan, the Middle East; and with its neighbors, particularly the fraught relationship with Ukraine. <i>Putin's World</i> will help Americans understand how and why the post-Cold War era has given way to a new, more dangerous world, one in which Russia poses a challenge to the US in every corner of the globe - and one in which Russia has become a toxic and divisive subject in US politics.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
