window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the acclaimed author of </b><b><i>Listen, Liberal</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>What’s the Matter with Kansas</i></b><b>, a scathing collection of his incisive commentary on our cruel times - perfect for this political moment. </b></p> <p>What does a middle-class democracy look like when it comes apart? When, after 40 years of economic triumph, America’s winners persuade themselves that they owe nothing to the rest of the country?&nbsp;</p> <p>With his sharp eye for detail, Thomas Frank takes us on a wide-ranging tour through present-day America, showing us a society in the late stages of disintegration and describing the worlds of both the winners and the losers - the sprawling mansion districts as well as the lives of fast-food workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Rendezvous with Oblivion</i> is a collection of interlocking essays examining how inequality has manifested itself in our cities, in our jobs, in the way we travel - and of course in our politics, where in 2016, millions of anxious ordinary people rallied to the presidential campaign of a billionaire who meant them no good.&nbsp;</p> <p>These accounts of folly and exploitation are here brought together in a single audiobook unified by Frank’s distinctive voice, sardonic wit, and anti-orthodox perspective. It captures a society where every status signifier is hollow, where the allure of mobility is just another con game, and where rebellion too often yields nothing.&nbsp;</p> <p>For those who despair of the future of our country and of reason itself, <i>Rendezvous with Oblivion</i> is a booster shot of energy, reality, and moral outrage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
