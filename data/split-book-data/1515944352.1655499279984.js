window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this mind-bending audiobook, an esteemed neuroscientist explains why perfectionism is pointless - and argues that mistakes, missteps, and flaws are the keys to success.</b></p> <p>Remember that time you screwed up simple math or forgot the name of your favorite song? What if someone told you that such embarrassing \"brain farts\" are actually secret weapons, proof of your superiority to computers and AI?</p> <p>In <i>Scatterbrain</i>, we learn that boredom awakens the muse, distractions spark creativity, and misjudging time creates valuable memories, among other benefits of our faulty minds. Throughout, award-winning neuroscientist Henning Beck's hilarious asides and brain-boosting advice make for a delightful account of the most cutting-edge neuroscience our brains will (maybe never) remember.</p>";
