window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The definitive, behind-the-scenes look at the US coronavirus crisis from one of the most recognizable and influential voices in healthcare</b></p> <p>From former head of Obamacare Andy Slavitt, <i>Preventable </i>is the definitive inside account of the United States' failed response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Slavitt chronicles what he saw and how much could have been prevented - an unflinching investigation of the cultural, political, and economic drivers that led to unnecessary loss of life.</p> <p>With unparalleled access to the key players throughout the government on both sides of the aisle, the principal public figures, as well as the people working on the frontline involved in fighting the virus, Slavitt brings you into the room as fateful decisions are made and focuses on the people at the center of the political system, health care system, patients, and caregivers. The story that emerges is one of a country in which - despite the heroics of many - bad leadership, political and cultural fractures, and an unwillingness to sustain sacrifice light a fuse that is difficult to extinguish.</p> <p>Written in the tradition of <i>The Big Short</i>, <i>Preventable </i>continues Andy Slavitt’s important work of addressing the uncomfortable realities that brought America to this place. And, he puts forth the solutions that will prevent us from being here again, ensuring a better, stronger country for everyone.<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press</b></p> <p>“Painfully good. The book could have been called, ‘Outrageous.’ The story Andy Slavitt tells is not just about Trump’s monumental failures but also about the deeper ones that started long before, with our health system, our politics, and more.” (Atul Gawande, author of <i>Being Mortal</i>)</p>";
