window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Talks on nonduality by one of the greatest spiritual teachers</b></p> <p>In this book of key spiritual teachings from unpublished discourses, the great Advaita Master, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, teaches us that we are not limited to the body. Because of our mistaken body identity, we feel separate from what we truly are. Our identification with the body and mind subjects us to endless cycles of pleasure and pain, desire and fear, which cause us to search beyond ourselves for that which we believe we lack.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to Sri Nisargadatta, all conditions, all names and appearances, emerge from ignorance and imagination, from the mind’s assumptions - assumptions due to not enquiring and therefore not appreciating the nature of reality. When we realize that we are not limited to the body, we find that we are already free, needing no liberation. We discover that we are not only free, but infinite and boundless.</p> <p>Sri Nisargadatta met his guru, Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj, at the age of 34 in 1933. Three years later, Sri Nisargadatta realised himself as the Supreme Reality, the transcendental Self. Through earnestly heeding the words of his Guru, he discovered he was that which is unmanifest and eternal - beyond the bondage of name, form, shape, and size. For many years, thousands of people came from all over India and the world to listen to Sri Nisargadatta’s teachings. His influence is still as powerful today as it was when he gave regular talks four decades ago. Undoubtedly one of the greatest spiritual teachers of all time, one can sense his depth of dedication to truth, rather than affluence, recognition, and agenda. His legendary plain-speaking way and heartfelt commitment to assisting those on the direct path will affect anyone serious about self-realisation and the transfiguration of consciousness.</p> <p>“This well-structured book outlines the fundamental teachings...and will undoubtedly be a significant addition to the Nisargadatta canon.” (Pradeep Apte)</p>";
