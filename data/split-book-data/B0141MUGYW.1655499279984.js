window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Our most cherished times are those occasions when we feel open, loving, free of worry yet able to respond when needed. Loch Kelly calls this the expression of open-hearted awareness, our natural foundation of mind that arises effortlessly whenever we step out of the usual mode of consciousness known as ego-identification. Created as a stand-alone program or a complement to his book of the same name, <i>Shift into Freedom</i> is a progressive training guide that offers \"small glimpses, many times\" to help us shift out of our chattering mind and into who we really are. </p> <ul> <li>Join this innovative teacher to explore more than 20 meditations including: </li> <li>Awareness Yoga - a foundational practice in moving awareness </li> <li>Embodied Presence - a practice for deeply feeling unity and acceptance </li> <li>Unhook, Drop, Open, See, Include, Know, Let Be - a way to shift levels of mind that culminates in living from open-hearted awareness </li> </ul> <p>\"The goal of these meditations is not to transcend the human condition,\" explains Loch Kelly, \"but to discover how to live a fully intimate human life.\" <i>Shift into Freedom</i> gives you the tools to navigate your life with clarity and unconditional love. </p>";
