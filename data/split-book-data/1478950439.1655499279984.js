window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>All people are equal but, as </b><b><i>Human Diversity</i></b><b> explores, all groups of people are not the same - a fascinating investigation of the genetics and neuroscience of human differences.</b></p> <p>The thesis of <i>Human Diversity</i> is that advances in genetics and neuroscience are overthrowing an intellectual orthodoxy that has ruled the social sciences for decades. The core of the orthodoxy consists of three dogmas:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Gender is a social construct.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Race is a social construct.<br> &nbsp;</li> <li>Class is a function of privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>The problem is that all three dogmas are half-truths. They have stifled progress in understanding the rich texture that biology adds to our understanding of the social, political, and economic worlds we live in.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is not a story to be feared. \"There are no monsters in the closet,\" Murray writes, \"no dread doors we must fear opening.\" But it is a story that needs telling. <i>Human Diversity</i> does so without sensationalism, drawing on the most authoritative scientific findings, celebrating both our many differences and our common humanity.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
