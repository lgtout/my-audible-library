window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"There is no author whose books I look forward to more than Vaclav Smil.\" (Bill Gates)</b></p> <p><b>An essential guide to understanding how numbers reveal the true state of our world - exploring a wide range of topics including energy, the environment, technology, transportation, and food production.</b></p> <p>Vaclav Smil's mission is to make facts matter. An environmental scientist, policy analyst, and a hugely prolific author, he is Bill Gates' go-to guy for making sense of our world. In<i>&nbsp;Numbers Don't Lie</i>, Smil answers questions such as: What's worse for the environment - your car or your phone? How much do the world's cows weigh (and what does it matter)? And what makes people happy?</p> <p>From data about our societies and populations, through measures of the fuels and foods that energize them, to the impact of transportation and inventions of our modern world - and how all of this affects the planet itself - in&nbsp;<i>Numbers Don't Lie</i>, Vaclav Smil takes us on a fact-finding adventure, using surprising statistics to challenge conventional thinking. Packed with fascinating information and memorable examples,<i>&nbsp;Numbers Don't Lie</i>&nbsp;reveals how the US is leading a rising worldwide trend in chicken consumption, that vaccination yields the best return on investment, and why electric cars aren't as great as we think (yet). Urgent and essential, with a mix of science, history, and wit - all in bite-sized chapters on a broad range of topics - <i>Numbers Don't Lie</i>&nbsp;inspires readers to interrogate what they take to be true.</p>";
