This is a journey through the high-tech aids for psychological growth that are changing our world, while exploring the safety, authenticity, and ethics of this new world.</b></p> <p>We already rely on technology to manage our health, sleep, relationships, and finances, so it’s no surprise that we’re turning to technological aids for the spiritual journey.

Through their own research and insiders’ access to the top innovators and early adopters, Wesley J. Wildman and Kate J. Stockly take you deep inside an evolving world:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Find out how increasingly popular “wearables” work on your brain, promising a shortcut to transformative meditative states</li> <li>.Meet the inventor of the “God Helmet” who developed a tool to increase psychic skills and overcome fear, sadness, and anger.</li> <li>Visit churches that use ayahuasca as their sacrament and explore the booming industry of psychedelic tourism.</li> <li>Journey to a mansion in the heart of Silicon Valley where a group of scientists and entrepreneurs are working feverishly to bring brain-based spirit tech applications to the masses.</li> <li>Discover a research team who achieved brain-to-brain communication between individuals thousands of miles apart, harnessing neurofeedback techniques to sync and share emotions among group members.</li> </ul> <p><i>Spirit Tech</i> offers listeners a compelling glimpse into the future and is the definitive guide to the fascinating world of new innovations for personal transformation, spiritual growth, and pushing the boundaries of human nature. <br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press </b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
