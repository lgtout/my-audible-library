window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Andrew Smart wants you to sit and do nothing much more often - and he has the science to explain why. </p> <p>At every turn we’re pushed to do more, faster, and more efficiently: That drumbeat resounds throughout our wage-slave society. Multitasking is not only a virtue, it’s a necessity. Books such as <i>Getting Things Done</i>, <i>The One Minute Manager</i>, and <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> regularly top the best seller lists, and have spawned a considerable industry. </p> <p>But Andrew Smart argues that slackers may have the last laugh. The latest neuroscience shows that the “culture of effectiveness” is not only ineffective, it can be harmful to your well-being. He makes a compelling case - backed by science - that filling life with activity at work and at home actually hurts your brain. </p> <p>A survivor of corporate-mandated “Six Sigma” training to improve efficiency, Smart has channeled a self-described “loathing” of the time-management industry into a witty, informative, and wide-ranging audiobook that draws on the most recent research into brain power. Use it to explain to bosses, family, and friends why you need to relax - right now. </p>";
