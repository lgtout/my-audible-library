window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Shortlisted for the International Booker prize, </b><b><i>The Employees</i></b><b> reshuffles a sci-fi voyage into a riotously original existential nightmare. </b></p> <p>Funny and doom-drenched, <i>The Employees</i> chronicles the fate of the Six-Thousand Ship. The human and humanoid crew members complain about their daily tasks in a series of staff reports and memos. When the ship takes on a number of strange objects from the planet New Discovery, the crew becomes strangely and deeply attached to them, even as tensions boil toward mutiny, especially among the humanoids.</p> <p>Olga Ravn’s prose is chilling, crackling, exhilarating, and foreboding. <i>The Employees</i> probes into what makes us human, while delivering a hilariously stinging critique of life governed by the logic of productivity.</p>";
