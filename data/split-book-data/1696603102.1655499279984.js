window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Mark Solms, one of the boldest thinkers in contemporary neuroscience, discovering how consciousness comes about has been a lifetime's quest. Scientists consider it the \"hard problem\" because it seems an impossible task to understand why we feel a subjective sense of self and how it arises in the brain.</p> <p>Venturing into the elementary physics of life, Solms has now arrived at an astonishing answer. In <i>The Hidden Spring</i>, he brings forward his discovery in accessible language and graspable analogies.</p> <p>Solms is a fearless guide on an extraordinary voyage from the dawn of neuropsychology and psychoanalysis to the cutting edge of contemporary neuroscience, adhering to the medically provable. But he goes beyond other neuroscientists by paying close attention to the subjective experiences of hundreds of neurological patients, many of whom he treated, whose uncanny conversations expose much about the brain's obscure reaches.</p> <p>Most importantly, you will be able to recognize the workings of your own mind for what they really are, including every stray thought, pulse of emotion, and shift of attention. <i>The Hidden Spring </i>will profoundly alter your understanding of your own subjective experience.</p>";
