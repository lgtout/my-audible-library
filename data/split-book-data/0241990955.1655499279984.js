window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brought to you by Penguin.</p> <p>What could a lacemaker have in common with vascular surgeons? A Savile Row tailor with molecular scientists? A fighter pilot with jazz musicians? At first glance, very little. But Roger Kneebone, an expert on experts, has spent his life finding unexpected connections.</p> <p>Kneebone maps out a path we're all following, whether in our career or any other part of our lives. He shows how you start by 'doing time' as an Apprentice, copying how things are already done. Then you set out on your own as a Journeyman, developing your 'voice' and taking full responsibility for your work, with its successes and inevitable failures. Finally, you become a Master, passing on your knowledge and skill to future generations. <i>Expert </i>explains the internal processes we all have to go through as we edge forwards.</p> <p>In this groundbreaking book, Kneebone combines his own experiences as a doctor with insights from extraordinary people and cutting-edge research. He tells a story that resonates with us all - the story of how we can become expert. Whether you're developing a new career, studying a language, learning a musical instrument or simply becoming the person you want to be, <i>Expert </i>reveals the path to mastery and shows what lies ahead.</p>";
