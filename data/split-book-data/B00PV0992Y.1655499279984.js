window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's a report tempered by hard times. In \"Matricide\", Daum unflinchingly describes a parent's death and the uncomfortable emotions it provokes; and in \"Diary of a Coma\" she relates her own journey to the twilight of the mind. But Daum also operates in a comic register. With perfect precision, she reveals the absurdities of the marriage-industrial complex, of the New Age dating market, and of the peculiar habits of the young and digital. Elsewhere, she writes searchingly about cultural nostalgia, Joni Mitchell, and the alternating heartbreak and liberation of choosing not to have children. </p>";
