window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Includes a brand-new afterword read by the author!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A respected, longtime Republican strategist, ad maker, and contributor for </b><b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Daily Beast </i></b><b>skewers the disease that is destroying the conservative movement and burning down the GOP: Trumpism.</b></p> <p>In <i>Everything Trump Touches Dies</i>, political campaign strategist and commentator Rick Wilson brings his darkly funny humor and biting analysis to the absurdity of American politics in the age of Trump. Wilson mercilessly exposes the damage Trump has done to the country, to the Republican Party he served for decades, and to the conservative movement that has abandoned its principles for the worst president in American history.</p> <p>No left-winger, Wilson is a lifelong conservative who delivers his withering critique of Trump from the right. A leader of the Never Trump movement, he warns his own party of the political catastrophe that leaves everyone involved with Trump with reputations destroyed and lives in tatters.</p> <p>Wilson unblinkingly dismantles Trumpâ€™s deceptions and the illusions to which his supporters cling, shedding light on the guilty parties who empower and enable Trump in Washington and the news media. He calls out the race-war dead-enders who hitched a ride with Trump, the alt-right basement dwellers who worship him, and the social conservatives who looked the other way.</p> <p><i>Everything Trump Touches Dies</i> deftly chronicles the tragicomic Trump story from the early campaign days through the shock of election night to the inconceivable train wreck of Trump's first year. Rick Wilson provides not only an insightful analysis of the Trump administration but also an optimistic path forward for the GOP, the conservative movement, and the country.</p> <p>Combining insider political analysis, blunt truths, and black humor, <i>Everything Trump Touches Dies </i>is perfect for those on either side of the aisle who need a dose of unvarnished reality, a good laugh, a strong cocktail, and a return to sanity in American politics.</p>";
