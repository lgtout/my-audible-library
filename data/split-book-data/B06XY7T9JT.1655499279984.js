window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Much of the advice we've been told about achievement is logical, earnest...and downright wrong. In <i>Barking up the Wrong Tree</i>, Eric Barker reveals the extraordinary science behind what actually determines success and, most importantly, how anyone can achieve it. You'll learn: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Why valedictorians rarely become millionaires and how your biggest weakness might actually be your greatest strength </li> <li>Whether nice guys finish last and why the best lessons about cooperation come from gang members, pirates, and serial killers </li> <li>Why trying to increase confidence fails and how Buddhist philosophy holds a superior solution </li> <li>The secret ingredient to \"grit\" that Navy SEALs and disaster survivors leverage to keep going </li> <li>How to find work-life balance using the strategy of Genghis Khan, the errors of Albert Einstein, and a little lesson from Spider-Man </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>By looking at what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, we learn what we can do to be more like them - and find out, in some cases, why it's good that we aren't. <i>Barking up the Wrong Tree</i> draws on startling statistics and surprising anecdotes to help you understand what works and what doesn't, so you can stop guessing at success and start living the life you want. </p>";
