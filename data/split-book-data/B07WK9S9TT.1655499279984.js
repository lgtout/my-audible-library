window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The American Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865, produced casualties and destruction on an unprecedented scale. Up to 800,000 soldiers were killed, and huge swathes of the American south were devastated. However, although the defeat of the Confederate States and the end of the war brought peace of a sort, it left many unresolved issues. The period following the end of the Civil War has become known as the Reconstruction Era, and during this time there were efforts to achieve two separate goals: to reintegrate the former rebel southern states fully into the Union and to achieve not only the abolition of slavery - which had been a war aim for the north - but also the emancipation and granting of civil rights to freed slaves.</p> <p>Inside you will listen about:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>The End of Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War</li> <li>Radical Reconstruction</li> <li>Carpetbaggers and Scalawags</li> <li>The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan</li> <li>Corruption and Recession</li> <li>And much more!&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>The Reconstruction Era proved almost as divisive as the Civil War itself - the freeing of slaves threatened to undermine the very basis of society and many southerners resisted. For some in the north, the unwillingness of people in the south to adopt new laws and new ways of life seemed to negate the whole point of the war. After all, what was the point of fighting and winning a war if the very things that were fought for failed to happen?</p> <p>The Reconstruction Era was a period of turmoil and change in the United States, and it ended not with a complete victory for either side but with a compromise which satisfied no-one. However, this period did pave the way for important changes which came much later. This is the complex and sometimes confusing story of the Reconstruction Era.</p>";
