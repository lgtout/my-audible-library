window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A brilliant and defiant celebration of driving as a unique pathway of human freedom, by \"one of the most influential thinkers of our time\" (</b><b><i>Sunday Times</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p><b>\"A thoughtful, entertaining, and substantive work about the joys of driving.\"&nbsp;(</b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b><i>\"Why We Drive&nbsp;</i></b><b>weaves philosophers, thinkers, and scientific research with shade-tree mechanics and racers to defend our right to independence, making the case that freedom of motion is essential to who we are as a species.... We hope you'll read it.\"&nbsp;(</b><b><i>Road &amp; Track</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Once we were drivers, the open road alive with autonomy, adventure, danger, trust, and speed. Today we are as likely to be in the back seat of an Uber as behind the wheel ourselves. Tech giants are hurling us toward a shiny, happy \"self-driving\" future, selling utopia but equally keen to advertise to a captive audience strapped into another expensive device. Are we destined, then, to become passengers, not drivers?<i> Why We Drive</i> reveals that much more may be at stake than we might think.</p> <p>Ten years ago, in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling <i>Shop Class as Soulcraft</i>, philosopher-mechanic Matthew B. Crawford - a University of Chicago PhD who owned his own motorcycle shop - made a revolutionary case for manual labor, one that ran headlong against the pretentions of white-collar office work. Now, using driving as a window through which to view the broader changes wrought by technology on all aspects of contemporary life, Crawford investigates the driver's seat as one of the few remaining domains of skill, exploration, play - and freedom. Blending philosophy and hands-on storytelling, Crawford grounds the narrative in his own experience in the garage and behind the wheel, recounting his decade-long restoration of a vintage Volkswagen as well as his journeys to thriving automotive subcultures across the country. Crawford leads us on an irreverent but deeply considered inquiry into the power of faceless bureaucracies, the importance of questioning mindless rules, and the battle for democratic self-determination against the surveillance capitalists.&nbsp;</p> <p>A meditation on the competence of ordinary people, <i>Why We Drive</i> explores the genius of our everyday practices on the road, the rewards of \"folk engineering\", and the existential value of occasionally being scared shitless.</p> <p>Witty and ingenious throughout, <i>Why We Drive</i> is a rebellious and daring celebration of the irrepressible human spirit.&nbsp;</p>";
