window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Thinking, Fast and Slow,&nbsp;</i></b><b>the co-author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Nudge,&nbsp;</i></b><b>and the author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>You Are About to Make a Terrible Mistake!&nbsp;</i></b><b>comes&nbsp;</b><b><i>Noise</i></b><b>, a revolutionary exploration of why people make bad judgments, and how to control both noise and cognitive bias.</b></p> <p>Imagine that two doctors in the same city give different diagnoses to identical patients - or that two judges in the same courthouse give&nbsp;markedly&nbsp;different sentences to people who have committed the same crime. Suppose that different interviewers at the same firm&nbsp;make different decisions about&nbsp;indistinguishable job applicants - or that when a company is handling customer complaints, the resolution depends on who happens to&nbsp;answer&nbsp;the&nbsp;phone. Now imagine that the same doctor, the same judge, the same interviewer, or the same&nbsp;customer service agent&nbsp;makes different decisions depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday. These are examples of noise: variability in judgments that should be identical.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>Noise</i>, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein&nbsp;show&nbsp;the&nbsp;detrimental effects of noise&nbsp;in many fields, including medicine, law,&nbsp;economic forecasting, forensic science, bail, child protection, strategy, performance reviews, and personnel selection.&nbsp;Wherever there is judgment, there is noise. Yet,&nbsp;most of the time, individuals and organizations alike&nbsp;are unaware of it. They neglect noise. With a few simple remedies, people can reduce both noise and bias, and so make far better decisions.</p> <p>Packed with original ideas, and offering the same kinds of&nbsp;research-based&nbsp;insights that made&nbsp;<i>Thinking, Fast and Slow&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Nudge</i>&nbsp;groundbreaking&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best sellers,&nbsp;<i>Noise</i>&nbsp;explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise in judgment - and what we can do about it.</p> <p><i>Cover design © HarperCollins Publishers 2021</i></p> <p><b>*&nbsp;This audiobook contains a downloadable PDF which includes figures from the book.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
