window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Overcome Anxiety</i> is an effective, practical, science-based, self-help book that will help ease anxiety, panic, worry and stress, and bring peace, calm, and courage to people who suffer from anxiety and stress - based on the successful Overcome Anxiety workshops of Dr. Matt Lewis. </p> <p>Maybe you're struggling with anxiety for the first time, or have lived with it for a very long time. This may be the first time you've looked for help, or you may have tried different methods to manage your anxiety before and remained stuck, or after some initial improvement you found yourself bogged down with the same anxious thoughts and feelings. Anxiety books and methods that promise instant and magical transformations to overcoming anxiety lose their impact when we have to leave our comfort zone and the fairy dust blows away. Whatever the case, you're probably looking for something that really works, something that is effective, practical, real, and evidence-based. </p> <p>There are three main steps in this revolutionary approach and I've seen it change people's lives time and time again. You're going to learn how to: </p> <li>Calm the mind </li> <li>Deal with anxious thoughts and feelings </li> <li>Take action </li> <p></p> <p>So the method goes beyond managing anxiety, it will also help you to become unstuck, build confidence and start really living. </p>";
