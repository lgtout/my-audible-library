window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Denying History</i> takes a bold and in-depth look at those who say the Holocaust never happened and explores the motivations behind such claims. While most commentators have dismissed the Holocaust deniers as antisemitic neo-Nazi thugs who do not deserve a response, historians Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman have immersed themselves in the minds and culture of these Holocaust \"revisionists.\" In the process, they show how we can be certain that the Holocaust happened and, for that matter, how we can confirm any historical event. <p>Includes an extensive analysis of other pseudohistory claims, such as the denial of the \"rape of Nanking\", the claim that Aristotle stole philosophy from African philosophers, the belief that early civilizations were egalitarian and peaceful, the notion that the Phoenicians (or the lost tribe of Israel) discovered America, and many others.</p>";
