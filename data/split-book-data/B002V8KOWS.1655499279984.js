window.bookSummaryJSON = "Quite unexpectedly, Mrs. Oedipa Maas finds herself the executor of the estate of Pierce Inverarity, a man she used to know in a more-or-less intimate fashion. When Oedipa heads off to Southern California to sort through Pierce's affairs, she becomes ensnared in a hilarious and puzzling worldwide conspiracy. <p>Calling Thomas Pynchon a \"virtuoso with prose\", the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> compares his work to James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>. Pynchon, winner of the National Book Award, has shocked, enthralled, and delighted fans for more than 40 years with his satire and wit.</p>";
