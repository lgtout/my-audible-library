window.bookSummaryJSON = "It seems that some people are born to achieve anything they want. Some would say they are lucky, are blessed, or have the Midas touch. But what truly is the reason for their success? Family background, wealth, greater opportunities, high morals, an easy childhood? <i>New York Times</i> best selling author John C. Maxwell has the answer: The difference between average people and achieving people is their perception of and response to failure. <p>Maxwell says that if you are like him, you were never prepared to deal with failure. Coming out of school, he feared it, misunderstood it, and ran away from it. But he's learned to make failure his friend, and he can teach you to do the same.</p>";
