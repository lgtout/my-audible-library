Tokarczuk's novel is funny, vivid, dangerous, and disturbing, and it raises some fierce questions about human behavior. My sincere admiration for her brilliant work.\" (Annie Proulx) </b></p> <p>In a remote Polish village, Janina devotes the dark winter days to studying astrology, translating the poetry of William Blake, and taking care of the summer homes of wealthy Warsaw residents. Her reputation as a crank and a recluse is amplified by her not-so-secret preference for the company of animals over humans. Then, a neighbor, Big Foot, turns up dead. Soon, other bodies are discovered, in increasingly strange circumstances. As suspicions mount, Janina inserts herself into the investigation, certain that she knows whodunit. If only anyone would pay her mind....</p> <p>A deeply satisfying thriller cum fairy tale, <i>Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead </i>is a provocative exploration of the murky borderland between sanity and madness, justice and tradition, autonomy and fate.
