window.bookSummaryJSON = "In <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>, Michael Shermer, the best-selling author of <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, the publisher of <i>Skeptic</i> magazine, and a monthly columnist for <i>Scientific American</i>, decodes the facts of evolution and shows how natural selection achieves the elegant design of life. <p>Shermer, once an evangelical Christian and a creationist, argues that Intelligent Design proponents invoke a combination of ad science, political antipathy, and flawed theology in their new brand of creationism. He refutes their pseudoscientific arguments and then demonstrates why conservatives and people of faith can and should embrace evolution. <i>Why Darwin Matters</i> is an incisive examination of what is at stake in the debate over evolution.</p>";
