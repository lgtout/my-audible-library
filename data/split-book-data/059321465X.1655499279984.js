window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A life-changing, research-based program that will end food allergies in children and adults forever</b></p> <p>The problem of food allergy is exploding around us. But this book offers the first glimpse of hope with a powerful message: You can work with your family and your doctor to eliminate your food allergy forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trailblazing research of Dr. Kari Nadeau at Stanford University reveals that food allergy is not a life sentence, because the immune system can be retrained. Food allergies - from mild hives to life-threatening airway constriction - can be disrupted, slowed, and stopped. The key is a strategy called immunotherapy (IT) - the controlled, gradual reintroduction of an allergen into the body.&nbsp;</p> <p>With innovations that include state-of-the-art therapies targeting specific components of the immune system, Dr. Nadeau and her team have increased the speed and effectiveness of this treatment to a matter of months.</p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Sloan Barnett, the mother of two children with food allergies, provides a lay perspective that helps make Dr. Nadeau's research accessible for everyone. Together, they walk listeners through every aspect of food allergy, including how to find the right treatment and how to manage the ongoing fear of allergens that haunts so many sufferers, to give us a clear, supportive plan to combat a major national and global health issue.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
