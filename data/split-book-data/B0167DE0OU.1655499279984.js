window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When does enlightenment come? At the end of the spiritual journey? Or the beginning? In <i>After the Ecstasy, the Laundry</i>, Jack Kornfield - author of the modern classic on American Buddhism, <i>A Path with Heart</i> - brings into focus the truth about satori, the awakened state of consciousness, and enlightenment practices today. The result is this extraordinary look at the hard work we all must do - the laundry - no matter how often we experience ecstatic states of consciousness through meditation and other disciplines. </p> <p>Sweeping in scope, and warmly told by one of American Buddhism's most trusted voices, <i>After the Ecstasy, the Laundry</i> is a work of both deep inspiration and daily instruction that cuts through the confusion about what enlightenment really is, who it comes to, and how it continues to inform and guide our spiritual lives. </p> <p>An original audio adaptation of Jack Kornfield's book, <i>After the Ecstasy, the Laundry</i>. </p>";
