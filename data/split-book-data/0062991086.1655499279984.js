window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of&nbsp;<i>Self-Compassion</i>&nbsp;follows up her groundbreaking book with new ideas that expand our notion of self-kindness and its capacity to transform our lives, showing women how to balance tender self-acceptance with fierce action to claim their power and change the world.</p> <p>Kristin Neff changed how we talk about self-care with her enormously popular first book,&nbsp;<i>Self-Compassion</i>. Now, 10 years and many studies later, she expands her body of work to explore a brand-new take on self-compassion. Although kindness and self-acceptance allow us to be with ourselves as we are, in all our glorious imperfection, the desire to alleviate suffering at the heart of this mindset isn't always gentle, sometimes it's fierce. We must also act courageously in order to protect ourselves from harm and injustice, say no to others so we can meet our own needs, and motivate necessary change in ourselves and society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Gender roles demand that women be soft and nurturing, not angry or powerful.&nbsp;But like yin and yang, the energies of fierce and tender self-compassion must be balanced for wholeness and well-being.&nbsp;Drawing on a wealth of research, her personal life story and empirically supported practices, Neff demonstrates how women can use fierce and tender self-compassion to succeed in the workplace, engage in caregiving without burning out, be authentic in relationships, and end the silence around sexual harassment and abuse. Most women intuitively recognize fierceness as part of their true nature, but have been discouraged from developing it. Women must reclaim their power in order to create a healthier society and find lasting happiness.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this wise, caring, and enlightening book, Neff shows women how to reclaim balance within themselves, so they can help restore balance in the world.</p>";
