window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>These days it’s hard to count on the world outside. So, it’s vital to grow strengths inside like grit, gratitude, and compassion - the key to resilience, and to lasting well-being in a changing world.</p> <p>True resilience is much more than enduring terrible conditions. We need resilience every day to raise a family, work at a job, cope with stress, deal with health problems, navigate issues with others, heal from old pain, and simply keep on going.</p> <p>With his trademark blend of neuroscience, mindfulness, and positive psychology, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Dr. Rick Hanson shows you how to develop 12 vital inner strengths hardwired into your own nervous system. Then no matter what life throws at you, you’ll be able to feel less stressed, pursue opportunities with confidence, and stay calm and centered in the face of adversity.</p> <p>This practical guide is full of concrete suggestions, experiential practices, personal examples, and insights into the brain. It includes effective ways to interact with others and to repair and deepen important relationships.</p> <p>Warm, encouraging, and down-to-earth, Dr. Hanson’s step-by-step approach is grounded in the science of positive neuroplasticity. He explains how to overcome the brain’s negativity bias, release painful thoughts and feelings, and replace them with self-compassion, self-worth, joy, and inner peace.</p>";
