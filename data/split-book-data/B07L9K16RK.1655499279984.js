window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A radical reconsideration of how we develop the qualities that make us human, based on decades of cutting-edge experimental work by the former director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Virtually all theories of how humans have become such a distinctive species focus on evolution. Here, Michael Tomasello proposes a complementary theory of human uniqueness, focused on development. Building on the seminal ideas of Vygotsky, his data-driven model explains how those things that make us most human are constructed during the first years of a child's life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Tomasello assembles nearly three decades of experimental work with chimpanzees, bonobos, and human children to propose a new framework for psychological growth between birth and seven years of age. He identifies eight pathways that starkly differentiate humans from their closest primate relatives: social cognition, communication, cultural learning, cooperative thinking, collaboration, prosociality, social norms, and moral identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Becoming Human</i> places human sociocultural activity within the framework of modern evolutionary theory and shows how biology creates the conditions under which culture does its work.</p>";
