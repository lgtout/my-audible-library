window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now the&nbsp;Netflix limited series&nbsp;<i>Unbelievable</i>,&nbsp;starring Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, and Kaitlyn&nbsp;Dever.</p> <p><b>Two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists tell the riveting true crime story of a teenager charged with lying about having been raped — and the detectives who followed a winding path to arrive at the truth.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>“Gripping.... [with a] John Grisham-worthy twist.” (Emily Bazelon,&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>,&nbsp;Editors’ Choice)</p> <p>On August 11, 2008, 18-year-old Marie reported that a masked man broke into her apartment near Seattle, Washington, and raped her. Within days police and even those closest to Marie became suspicious of her story: details of the crime didn't seem plausible, and her foster mother thought she sounded as though she were reciting a <i>Law &amp; Order</i> episode. The police swiftly pivoted and began investigating Marie. Confronted with inconsistencies in her story and the doubts of others, Marie broke down and said her story was a lie - a bid for attention. Police charged Marie with false reporting. One of Marie's best friends created a web page branding her a liar.&nbsp;</p> <p>More than two years later, Colorado detective Stacy Galbraith was assigned to investigate a case of sexual assault. Describing the crime to her husband that night - the attacker's calm and practiced demeanor, which led the victim to surmise \"he's done this before\" - Galbraith learned that the case bore an eerie resemblance to a rape that had taken place months earlier in a nearby town. She joined forces with the detective on that case, Edna Hendershot, and the two soon realized they were dealing with a serial rapist: a man who photographed his victims, threatening to release the images online, and whose calculated steps to erase all physical evidence suggested he might be a soldier or a cop. Through meticulous police work the detectives would eventually connect the rapist to other attacks in Colorado - and beyond.&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on investigative files and extensive interviews with the principals, <i>Unbelievable</i> is a serpentine tale of doubt, lies, and a hunt for justice, unveiling the disturbing reality of how sexual assault is investigated today - and the long history of skepticism toward rape victims.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Previously published as&nbsp;</b><b><i>A False Report </i></b></p>";
