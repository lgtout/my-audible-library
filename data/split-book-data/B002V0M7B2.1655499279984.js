window.bookSummaryJSON = "With his unmatched investigative skill, Bob Woodward tells the behind-the-scenes story of how President George W. Bush and his top national security advisers, after the initial shock of the September 11 attacks, led the nation to war. <p>Extensive quotations from the secret deliberations of the National Security Council - and firsthand revelations of the private thoughts, concerns, and fears of the president and his war cabinet - make <i>Bush at War</i> an unprecedented chronicle of a modern presidency in a time of grave crisis.</p> <p>Based on interviews with more than a hundred sources and four hours of exclusive interviews with the president, <i>Bush at War</i> reveals Bush's sweeping, almost grandiose, vision for remaking the world. \"I'm not a textbook player, I'm a gut player,\" the president said.</p> <p>Woodward's virtual wiretap into the White House Situation Room reveals a stunning group portrait of an untested president and his advisers, three of whom might themselves have made it to the presidency. In <i>Bush at War</i>, Bob Woodward once again delivers a reporting tour de force.</p>";
