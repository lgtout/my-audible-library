window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A compelling foundation for a new story of interconnectedness, showing how, as our civilization unravels, another world is possible. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Award-winning author, Jeremy Lent, investigates humanity's age-old questions - Who am I? Why am I? How should I live? - from a fresh perspective, weaving together findings from modern systems thinking, evolutionary biology, and cognitive neuroscience with insights from Buddhism, Taoism, and Indigenous wisdom.&nbsp;</p> <p>The result is a breathtaking accomplishment: a rich, coherent worldview based on a deep recognition of connectedness within ourselves, between each other, and with the entire natural world.&nbsp;</p> <p>As our civilization careens toward a precipice of climate breakdown, ecological destruction, and gaping inequality, people are losing their existential moorings. Our dominant worldview of disconnection - which tells us we are split between mind and body, separate from each other, and at odds with the natural world - has passed its expiration date.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet another world <i> is </i> possible.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Web of Meaning </i>offers a compelling foundation for the new story that could enable humanity to thrive sustainably on a flourishing Earth. It's a book for everyone looking for deep and coherent answers to the crisis of civilization.&nbsp;</p>";
