window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the Silver Sports Podcast award at the 2020 British Podcast Awards</b></p> <p>This is a story about football - or soccer as it’s known in the US. The highs, the lows, historic match days, and foul play. It’s a celebration of a beloved player, a history maker, and his tragic ending at the final whistle. It’s a story about science and discovery, about the people on the frontline of life-changing research. But above all, it’s a story about family, and about consequence.</p> <p>All of this is wrapped up in three little letters: C.T.E. A four-part investigative documentary from multi award-winning producer Hana Walker-Brown, <i>The Beautiful Brain</i> looks at the devastating effects of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)—a degenerative brain disease found in people who’ve suffered severe or repeated blows to the head.</p> <p>Beginning with the story of FA Cup winner Jeff Astle, the podcast expands outwards looking at the widows, daughters and families who are left fighting for answers following the death of their loved ones. As the series progresses Hana’s investigation leads her from Britain’s football pitches to support groups for victims of domestic violence and beyond, sparking a vital discussion about accountability and the urgent need for further scientific studies into CTE.&nbsp;</p>";
