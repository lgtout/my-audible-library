window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An urgent manifesto for global democracy from Joshua Wong, the 23-year-old phenomenon leading Hong Kong's protests - and Nobel Peace Prize nominee - with an introduction by Ai Weiwei</b></p> <p>With global democracy under threat, we must act together to defend our rights: now.</p> <p>When he was 14, Joshua Wong made history. While the adults stayed silent, Joshua staged the first-ever student protest in Hong Kong to oppose National Education - and won.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since then, Joshua has led the Umbrella Movement, founded a political party, and rallied the international community around the anti-extradition bill protests, which have seen two million people - more than a quarter of the population - take to Hong Kong's streets. His actions have sparked worldwide attention, earned him a Nobel Peace Prize nomination, and landed him in jail twice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Composed in three parts, <i>Unfree Speech</i> chronicles Joshua's path to activism, collects the letters he wrote as a political prisoner under the Chinese state, and closes with a powerful and urgent call for all of us globally to defend our democratic values.&nbsp;</p> <p>When we stay silent, no one is safe. When we free our speech, our voice becomes one.</p>";
