window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why do babies have lopsided smiles? Why are so many people's eyes misaligned? What started as a simple search to understand this phenomenon turned into a two-year quest that uncovered hidden links between our crooked faces and some of the most puzzling diseases of our time.</p> <p>From autism to Alzheimer's and from chronic fatigue syndrome to Crohn's disease, <i>Crooked </i>methodically goes through the most recent scientific research and connects the dots from the outbreak of metallic medicine in 1800s England to the eruption of neurological and autoimmune disorders so many are suffering from today.</p> <p>If the theories put forth in this audiobook are true, the convergence of metals, microbes, and medicine that started 200 years ago may have set humanity on a path of suffering that could make the deadliest epidemics in history pale in comparison. Thankfully, for the millions who are afflicted, who may have found nothing to explain the cause of their suffering - these same theories could also illuminate the path to healing and recovery.</p>";
