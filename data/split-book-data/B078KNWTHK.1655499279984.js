window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From Inc.com's most popular columnist, a counterintuitive - but highly practical - guide to finding and maintaining the motivation to achieve great things.</b> </p> <p>It's comforting to imagine that superstars in their fields were just born better equipped than the rest of us. When a co-worker loses 20 pounds, or a friend runs a marathon while completing a huge project at work, we assume they have more grit, more willpower, more innate talent, and above all, more motivation to see their goals through. </p> <p>But that's not at actually true, as popular Inc.com columnist Jeff Haden proves. \"Motivation\" as we know it is a myth. Motivation isn't the special sauce that we require at the beginning of any major change. In fact, motivation is a <i>result </i>of process, not a cause. Understanding this will change the way you approach any obstacle or big goal. </p> <p>Haden shows us how to reframe our thinking about the relationship of motivation to success. He meets us at our level - at the beginning of any big goal we have for our lives, a little anxious and unsure about our way forward, a little burned by self-help books and strategies that have failed us in the past - and offers practical advice that anyone can use to stop stalling and start working on those dreams. </p> <p>Haden takes the mystery out of accomplishment, proving that success isn't about spiritual awakening or a lightning bolt of inspiration - as Tony Robbins and adherents of The Secret believe - but instead, about clear and repeatable processes. Using his own advice, Haden has consistently drawn two million views a month to his posts, completed a 107-mile long mountain bike race, and lost 10 pounds in a month. </p> <p>Success isn't for the uniquely-qualified; it's possible for any person who understands the true nature of motivation. Jeff Haden can help you transcend average and make lasting positive change in your life. </p>";
