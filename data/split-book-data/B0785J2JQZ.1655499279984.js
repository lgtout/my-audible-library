window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Embrace the Possibility of Your Own Evolution</b> </p> <p>Over the course of our lifetimes, human beings grow and change without cease. But what does it actually mean to transform ourselves - to take hold of our personal evolution and direct it for the better? </p> <p>Ken Wilber - one of the most widely read and influential philosophers of our time - has spent four decades in the pursuit of the answers to that question. In <i>Integral Transformation: What Works</i>, Ken applies the timeless insights of Eastern wisdom traditions with more recent discoveries in the fields of Western psychology to the issue, encouraging listeners toward the realization of their true divine nature. For Ken, this path requires no less than total self-acceptance - including those internal Shadow qualities that we have disowned and would rather not face. </p> <p>Hosted by Sounds True publisher and founder Tami Simon, these three sessions cover the arc of understanding just what personal transformation means, applying the life practices needed to catalyze change, and embracing the grand implications of a universe in which self and Kosmos are one. Join Ken Wilber for an illuminating odyssey into yourself - a fantastic journey toward fulfilling your highest potential. </p>";
