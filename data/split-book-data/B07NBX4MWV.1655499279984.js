window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Despite our best efforts, most of the time, we act without thinking. We make poor decisions. But this isn’t our fault! It’s just how our brains are programmed. Now, you don’t have to be a scientist to understand how to use your brain’s instincts to your advantage instead of your downfall.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Build a Better Brain</i> has one goal: to help you improve your life by understanding how your brain works and learning to taking advantage of it. Put simply, your brain still thinks it is 10,000 BC, and this has the potential to sabotage you on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p> <p>This audiobook is a deep look into the roots of conscious and unconscious behavior. It’s your introduction to neurosciencem, written for non-scientists and packed with advice. At the end of the day, this audiobook is a guide for how to rewire your brain for optimal performance and happiness.&nbsp;</p> <p>Peter Hollins has studied psychology and peak human performance for over a dozen years and is a best-selling author. He has worked with dozens of individuals to unlock their potential and path toward success. His writing draws on his academic, coaching, and research experience.
