window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can a computer have a soul? Are religion and science mutually exclusive? Is there really such a thing as free will? If you could time travel to visit Jesus, would you (and should you)? For hundreds of years, philosophers, scientists, and science-fiction writers have pondered these questions and many more.</p> <p>In <i>Holy Sci-Fi!</i>, popular writer Paul Nahin explores the fertile and sometimes uneasy relationship between science fiction and religion. With a scope spanning the history of religion, philosophy, and literature, Nahin follows religious themes in science fiction from Feynman to Foucault and from Asimov to Aristotle.</p> <p>An intriguing journey through popular and well-loved books and stories, <i>Holy Sci-Fi!</i> shows how sci-fi has informed humanity’s attitudes toward our faiths, our future, and ourselves.</p>";
