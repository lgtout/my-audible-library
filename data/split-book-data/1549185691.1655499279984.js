window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The provocative best seller explaining the decline of power in the 21st century - in government, business, and beyond.</b></p> <p>Power is shifting - from large, stable armies to loose bands of insurgents, from corporate leviathans to nimble start-ups, and from presidential palaces to public squares. But power is also changing, becoming harder to use and easier to lose. In <i>The End of Power</i>, award-winning columnist and former Foreign Policy editor Moisés Naím illuminates the struggle between once-dominant megaplayers and the new micropowers challenging them in every field of human endeavor. Drawing on provocative, original research and a lifetime of experience in global affairs, Naím explains how the end of power is reconfiguring our world.</p> <p><b>\"</b><b><i>The End of Power</i></b><b> will...change the way you look at the world.\" (Bill Clinton)</b></p> <p><b>\"Extraordinary.\" (George Soros)</b></p> <p><b>\"Compelling and original.\" (Arianna Huffington)</b></p> <p><b>\"A fascinating new perspective...Naím makes eye-opening connections.\" (Francis Fukuyama)</b></p>";
