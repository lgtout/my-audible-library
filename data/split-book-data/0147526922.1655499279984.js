As addictive as it is comprehensive, this is Bryson at his very best, a must-listen owner's manual for everybody.</b></p> <p>Bill Bryson once again proves himself to be an incomparable companion as he guides us through the human body - how it functions, its remarkable ability to heal itself, and (unfortunately) the ways it can fail. Full of extraordinary facts (your body made a million red blood cells since you started reading this) and irresistible Bryson-esque anecdotes, <i>The Body</i> will lead you to a deeper understanding of the miracle that is life in general and you in particular.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Bill Bryson writes, \"We pass our existence within this wobble of flesh and yet take it almost entirely for granted.\" <i>The Body</i> will cure that indifference with generous doses of wondrous, compulsively listenable facts and information.&nbsp;</p>";
