window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Opioids claim the lives of 115 people per day. One of them could have been me.”</b></p> <p>When a near-fatal illness led his doctors to prescribe narcotics, media consultant Timothy McMahan King ended up where millions of others have: addicted. Eventually King learned to manage pain without opioids - but not before he began asking profound questions about the spiritual and moral nature of addiction, the companies complicit in creating the opioid epidemic, and the paths toward healing and recovery.</p> <p>We have become a society not only damaged by addiction, but fueled by it. In <i>Addiction Nation</i>, King investigates the ways that addiction robs us of freedom and holds us back from being fully human. Through stories, theology, philosophy, and cultural analysis, King examines today’s most common addictions and their destructive consequences. In stark yet intimate prose, he looks not only at the rise of opioid abuse but at policy, pain, virtue, and habit. He also unpacks research showing patterns of addiction to technology, stress, and even political partisanship.</p> <p>Addiction of any kind dims the image of God and corrupts who we were created to be. <i>Addiction Nation </i>nudges us toward healing from the ravages of addiction and draws us toward a spirituality sturdy enough to sate our deepest longings.</p>";
