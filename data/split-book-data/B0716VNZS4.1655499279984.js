window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Seattle spinal surgeon Dr. David Hanscom focuses on an aspect of chronic pain that the medical world has largely overlooked: you must calm your nervous system in order to get better. More than any other book about pain, <i>Back in Control</i> reveals how to quiet a turbocharged central nervous system and make a full recovery, with or without surgery. Dr. Hanscom shares the story of his own journey out of chronic pain and offers a treatment paradigm that has evolved from his personal experience, as well what he has learned from his patients, hundreds of whom have moved beyond managing pain to becoming pain free. This book will enable those suffering from chronic pain to regain control of their care and life. </p> <p>This revised second edition reflects the last few years of neuroscience research. It is becoming increasingly clear that the brain processes mental and physical pain in a similar manner. As anxiety drops, pain will diminish. Dr. Hanscom has observed that these principles apply to any chronic pain condition. </p>";
