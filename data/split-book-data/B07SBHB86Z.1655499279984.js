window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Millions of people meditate daily. Many believe it affects how we feel and behave. But can we actually change through meditation? Does it work like a pill to alleviate stress? Can it put us on the path to personal transformation?&nbsp;</p> <p>Psychologists Dr Miguel Farias and Catherine Wikholm explore the human ambition for personal change and its possible illusions, with a focus on yoga and meditation.&nbsp;</p> <p>They examine the psychological and biological evidence, from early research on transcendental meditation to recent brain-imaging studies on mindfulness. They also include personal accounts from practitioners as well as recounting their own experiences of testing the effects of meditation and yoga on incarcerated criminals.</p>";
