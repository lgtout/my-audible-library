window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Best Book of 2021 by </b><b><i>Esquire</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Book You Need to Read in 2021 by</b> <b><i>Harper’​s Bazaar</i></b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>“Darkly funny and glitteringly satirical, </b><b><i>The Atmospherians</i></b><b> unforgettably takes aim at wokeness, wellness, and toxic masculinity.” (</b><b><i>Esquire)</i></b></p> <p><b>This “edgy, addictive” (</b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b>, starred) satire about two best friends who form The Atmosphere — a cult designed to reform problematic men — is “a book to be devoured” (</b><b><i>Vanity Fair</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p>Sasha Marcus was once the epitome of contemporary success: an internet sensation, social media darling, and a creator of a high-profile wellness brand for women. But a confrontation with an abusive troll has taken a horrifying turn, and now she’s at rock bottom: canceled and doxxed online, isolated in her apartment while men’s rights protestors rage outside.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sasha confides in her oldest childhood friend, Dyson — a failed actor with a history of body issues — who hatches a plan for her to restore her reputation by becoming the face of his new business venture, The Atmosphere: a rehabilitation community for men. Based in an abandoned summer camp and billed as a workshop for job training, it is actually a rigorous program designed to rid men of their toxic masculinity. Sasha has little choice but to accept. But what horrors await her as the resident female leader of a crew of washed up, desperate men? And what exactly does Dyson want?</p> <p>Explosive, dazzling, and wickedly funny, <i>The Atmospherians</i> is “a book written with this exact cultural moment in mind” (<i>Oprah Daily</i>).</p>";
