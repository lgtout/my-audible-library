window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Find out how to successfully resolve your most emotionally charged conflicts. In this landmark book, world-renowned Harvard negotiation expert Daniel Shapiro presents a groundbreaking, practical method to reconcile your most contentious relationships and untangle your toughest conflicts.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Before you get into your next conflict, listen to <i>Negotiating the Nonnegotiable</i>. It is not just another book on conflict resolution but a crucial step-by-step guide to resolve life's most emotionally challenging conflicts - whether between spouses, a parent and child, a boss and an employee, or rival communities or nations. These conflicts can feel nonnegotiable because they threaten your identity and trigger what Shapiro calls the tribes effect - a divisive mind-set that pits you against the other side. Once you fall prey to this mind-set, even a trivial argument with a family member or colleague can mushroom into an emotional uproar.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shapiro offers a powerful way out, drawing on his pioneering research and global fieldwork in consulting for everyone from heads of state to business leaders, embattled marital couples to families in crisis. And he shares his insights from negotiating with three of the world's toughest negotiators: his three young sons. This is a must-listen to improve your professional and personal relationships.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
