window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Enlightenment” - is it a myth or is it real? In every spiritual tradition, inner explorers have discovered that the liberated state is in fact a natural experience, as real as the sensations you are having right now - and that through the investigation of your own thoughts, feelings, and perceptions you can awaken to clear insight and a happiness independent of conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For decades, one of the most engaging teachers of our time has illuminated the many dimensions of awakening - but solely at his live retreats and on audio recordings. Now, with <i>The Science of Enlightenment</i>, Shinzen Young brings to listeners an uncommonly lucid guide to mindfulness meditation for the first time: how it works and how to use it to enhance your cognitive capacities, your kindness and connection with the world, and the richness of all your experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As thousands of his students and listeners will confirm, Shinzen is like no other teacher you’ve ever encountered. He merges scientific clarity, a rare grasp of source-language teachings East and West, and a gift for sparking insight through unexpected analogies, illustrations, humor, and firsthand accounts that reveal the inner journey to be as wondrous as any geographical expedition. Join him here to explore:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Universal insights spanning Buddhism, Christian and Jewish mysticism, shamanism, the yogas of India, and many other paths</li> <li>How to begin and navigate your own meditation practice</li> <li><i>Concentration, clarity</i>, and<i> equanimity - </i>the core catalysts of awakening</li> <li><i>Impermanence - </i>its many aspects and how to work with them</li> <li>Experiencing the “wave” and “particle” natures of self</li> <li><i>Purification </i>and <i>clarification - </i>how we digest mental blockages and habits through inner work</li> <li>Emerging neuroscience research, the future of enlightenment, and much more&nbsp;</li> </ul>";
