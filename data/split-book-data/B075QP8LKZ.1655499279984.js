window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A New Resource for Those Experiencing Loss</b> </p> <p>With <i>It's OK That You're Not OK</i>, Megan Devine offers a profound new approach to both the experience of grief and the way we help others who have endured tragedy. Having experienced grief from both sides - as both a therapist and as a woman who witnessed the accidental drowning of her beloved partner - Megan writes with deep insight about the unspoken truths of loss, love, and healing. She debunks the culturally prescribed goal of returning to a normal, \"happy\" life, replacing it with a far healthier middle path, one that invites us to build a life alongside grief rather than seeking to overcome it. </p> <p>On this unabridged audio recording read by the author, Megan offers stories, research, life tips, and creative and mindfulness-based practices to guide us through an experience we all must face. With Megan's gentle but direct guidance, you'll learn: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Why well-meaning advice, therapy, and spiritual wisdom so often end up making it harder for people in grief </li> <li>How challenging the myths of grief - doing away with stages, timetables, and unrealistic ideals about how grief should unfold - allows us to accept it as a mystery to be honored instead of a problem to solve </li> <li>Practical guidance for managing stress, improving sleep, and decreasing anxiety without trying to \"fix\" your pain </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Many people who have suffered a loss feel judged, dismissed, and misunderstood by a culture that wants to \"solve\" grief. Megan writes, \"Grief no more needs a solution than love needs a solution.\" It's OK That You're Not OK is a book for grieving people, those who love them, and all those seeking to love themselves - and each other - better. </p>";
