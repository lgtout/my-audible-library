window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A powerful guide to owning our emotions - even the difficult ones - in order to show up authentically in the world, from the popular therapist behind the Instagram account @sitwithwhit.</b></p> <p>Every day, we’re bombarded with pressure to be positive. From “good vibes only” and “life is good” memes, to endless advice, to “look on the bright side”, we’re constantly told that the key to happiness is silencing negativity wherever it crops up, in ourselves and in others. Even when faced with illness, loss, breakups, and other challenges, there’s little space for talking about our real feelings - and processing them so that we can feel better and move forward.</p> <p>But if all this positivity is the answer, why are so many of us anxious, depressed, and burned out?</p> <p>In this refreshingly honest guide, sought-after therapist Whitney Goodman shares the latest research along with everyday examples and client stories that reveal how damaging toxic positivity is to ourselves and our relationships, and presents simple ways to experience and work through difficult emotions. The result is more authenticity, connection, and growth - and ultimately, a path to showing up as you truly are.</p>";
