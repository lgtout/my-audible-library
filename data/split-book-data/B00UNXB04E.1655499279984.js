window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You don't need a book to tell you this much: Sometimes things fall apart, crack open, and miss the mark. You can plan and strategize and keep your eye on the horizon, watching for trouble. And nothing you can do will protect you from the fact that things might, when you least expect it, go terribly, horribly wrong. If you're anxious about this, it's not like you don't have a reason. If you're very anxious about this, you're certainly not alone. In fact, even if your whole life feels like it's about anxiety, your story is a lot more common that you might imagine. </p> <p>If you could just get your anxiety to go away, you could get on with the business of living your life, right? Well, maybe - or maybe not. Does anxiety need to go away in order for you to live your life fully, vitally, with richness and purpose? </p> <p>This audiobook approaches the problem of anxiety a little differently than most. Instead of trying to help you overcome or reduce feelings of anxiety, <i>Things Might Go Terribly, Horribly Wrong</i> will help you climb inside these feelings, sit in that place, and see what it would be like to have anxiety and still make room in your life to breathe and rest and live - really and truly live - in a way that matters to you. </p> <p>Although it's grounded in a research-supported form of psychotherapy called acceptance and commitment therapy, also known as ACT, <i>Things</i> isn't especially technical or stepwise. Rather, the book starts a conversation about why we all sometimes feel anxious and what role that anxiety serves in our lives. It connects the experience of anxiety to the essential experience of human suffering. And then, in sometimes unexpected ways, <i>Things</i> explores some basic ways of being in the world that can change the role anxiety plays in your life. </p> <p><i>This book has been awarded The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit - an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books.</i> </p>";
