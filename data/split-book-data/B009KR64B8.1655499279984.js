window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Intuitive Eating</i>&nbsp;is the go-to book on rebuilding a healthy body image and making peace with food. We’ve all been there - angry with ourselves for overeating, for our lack of willpower, for failing at yet another diet. But the problem isn’t us; it’s that dieting, with its strict rules, keeps us from listening to our bodies. Written by two prominent nutritionists,&nbsp;<i>Intuitive Eating</i>&nbsp;will teach you how to reject diet mentality forever; how our three eating&nbsp;\"personalities\"&nbsp;define our eating difficulties; how to find satisfaction in your eating; how to feel your feelings without using food; how to honor hunger and feel fullness; how to follow the 10 principles of \"intuitive eating\"; how to achieve a new and safe relationship with food and, ultimately, your body; and more. </p> <p>This revised edition includes updates and expansions throughout, as well as two brand-new chapters that will help readers integrate intuitive eating even more fully into their daily lives.</p>";
