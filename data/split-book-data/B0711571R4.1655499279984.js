window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A compelling, definitive account of how and why bin Laden's ideology keeps rising from the dead. </p> <p>In early 2011, the heart of the Muslim world roiled in protest, consumed with the upheaval of the Arab Spring. The governments of Tunisia and Egypt had already fallen; those of Libya and Yemen would soon follow. Watching the chaos from his hideout in Pakistan, Osama bin Laden saw a historic opportunity: \"The next stage,\" he declared, \"will be the reinstating of the rule of the caliphate.\" </p> <p>Within weeks, bin Laden was dead, shot in the dark by a US Navy SEAL. Commentators around the world began to prophesy al-Qaeda's imminent demise. But six years later, the reality is the reverse. The group's affiliates have swollen, and the Islamic State - al-Qaeda's most brutal spinoff to date - proclaims itself the reborn caliphate bin Laden foretold in his final weeks. </p> <p>In <i>Anatomy of Terror</i>, former FBI special agent and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Ali Soufan dissects bin Laden's brand of jihadi terrorism and its major offshoots, revealing how these organizations were formed, how they operate, their strengths, and - crucially - their weaknesses. This riveting account examines the new Islamic radicalism through the eyes of its flag-bearers, including a Jordanian former drug dealer whose cruelties shocked even his fellow militants, an Air Force colonel who once served Saddam Hussein, and a provincial bookworm who declared himself caliph of all Muslims. We meet Ayman al-Zawahiri, titular head of al-Qaeda; Saif al-Adel, an Egyptian ex-soldier who faked his own death to become the group's security chief; and bin Laden's own beloved son Hamza, a prime candidate to lead the organization his late father founded. </p> <p>To eliminate the scourge of terrorism, we must first know who the enemy actually is, and what his motivations are. <i>Anatomy of Terror</i> lays bare the psychology and inner workings of al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and their spawn, and shows how the spread of terror can be stopped. </p>";
