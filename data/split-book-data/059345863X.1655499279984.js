window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What does it take to reinvent a language?</b></p> <p>After a meteoric rise, China today is one of the world’s most powerful nations. Just a century ago, it was a crumbling empire with literacy reserved for the elite few, as the world underwent a massive technological transformation that threatened to leave them behind. In <i>Kingdom of Characters</i>, Jing Tsu argues that China’s most daunting challenge was a linguistic one: the century-long fight to make the formidable Chinese language accessible to the modern world of global trade and digital technology.</p> <p><i>Kingdom of Characters</i> follows the bold innovators who reinvented the Chinese language, among them an exiled reformer who risked a death sentence to advocate for Mandarin as a national language, a Chinese Muslim poet who laid the groundwork for Chairman Mao's phonetic writing system, and a computer engineer who devised input codes for Chinese characters on the lid of a teacup from the floor of a jail cell. Without their advances, China might never have become the dominating force we know today.</p> <p>With larger-than-life characters and an unexpected perspective on the major events of China’s tumultuous 20th century, Tsu reveals how language is both a technology to be perfected and a subtle, yet potent, power to be exercised and expanded.</p> <p><b>This audiobook includes a downloadable PDF that contains charts, photos, and visuals from the book.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
