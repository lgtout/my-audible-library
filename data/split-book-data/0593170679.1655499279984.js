O. Wilson)</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>“Hope Jahren asks the central question of our time: how can we learn to live on a finite planet?</b><b><i> The Story of More</i></b><b>&nbsp;is thoughtful, informative, and - above all - essential.” (Elizabeth Kolbert, author of </b><b><i>The Sixth Extinction</i></b><b>)&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Hope Jahren is an award-winning scientist, a brilliant writer, a passionate teacher, and one of the seven billion people with whom we share this earth. In <i>The Story of More</i>, she illuminates the link between human habits and our imperiled planet. In concise, highly understandable chapters, she takes us through the science behind the key inventions - from electric power to large-scale farming to automobiles - that, even as they help us, release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere like never before. She explains the current and projected consequences of global warming - from superstorms to rising sea levels - and the actions that we all can take to fight back.&nbsp;</p> <p>At once an explainer on the mechanisms of global change and a lively, personal narrative given to us in Jahren’s inimitable voice, <i>The Story of More</i> is the essential pocket primer on climate change that will leave an indelible impact on everyone who reads it.</p>";
