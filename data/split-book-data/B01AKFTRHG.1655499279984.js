window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Buck up.\" \"Stop feeling sorry for yourself.\" \"Don't ruin everything.\" When you are anxious, sad, angry, or lonely, do you hear this self-critical voice? What would happen if, instead of fighting difficult emotions, we accepted them? </p> <p>Over his decades of experience as a therapist and mindfulness meditation practitioner, Dr. Christopher Germer has learned a paradoxical lesson: We all want to avoid pain, but letting it in and responding compassionately to our own imperfections are essential steps on the path to healing. This wise and eloquent book illuminates the power of self-compassion and offers creative, scientifically grounded strategies for putting it into action. You'll master practical techniques for living more fully in the present moment - especially when hard-to-bear emotions arise - and for being kind to yourself when you need it the most. </p>";
