window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the creator of </b><b><i>The Good Place</i></b><b> and the cocreator of </b><b><i>Parks and Recreation</i></b><b>, a hilarious, thought-provoking guide to living an ethical life, drawing on 2,500 years of deep thinking from around the world. Read by the author, this one-of-a-kind audio production features guest appearances by members of the cast of </b><b><i>The Good Place</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Most people think of themselves as “good\", but it’s not always easy to determine what’s “good” or “bad” - especially in a world filled with complicated choices and pitfalls and booby traps and bad advice. Fortunately, many smart philosophers have been pondering this conundrum for millennia, and they have guidance for us. With bright wit and deep insight, <i>How to Be Perfect</i> explains concepts like deontology, utilitarianism, existentialism, ubuntu, and more, so we can sound cool at parties <i>and</i> become better people.</p> <p>Schur starts off with easy ethical questions like “Should I punch my friend in the face for no reason?” (No.) and works his way up to the most complex moral issues we all face. Such as: Can I still enjoy great art if it was created by terrible people? How much money should I give to charity? Why bother being good at all when there are no consequences for being bad? And much more. By the time the book is done, we’ll know exactly how to act in every conceivable situation, so as to produce a verifiably maximal amount of moral good. We will be perfect, and all our friends will be jealous. Okay, not quite. Instead, we’ll gain fresh, funny, inspiring wisdom on the toughest issues we face every day.</p> <p><i>How to Be Perfect </i>is narrated by Michael Schur, Kristen Bell, D’Arcy Carden, Ted Danson, William Jackson Harper, Manny Jacinto, Marc Evan Jackson, Jameela Jamil, and Todd May!</p>";
