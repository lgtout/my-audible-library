window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The future isn’t about where we will work, but how. For years we have struggled to balance work and life, with most of us feeling overwhelmed and burned out because our relationship to work is broken. This&nbsp;“isn't just a book about remote work. It's a book that helps us imagine a future where our lives - at the office </b><b><i>and</i></b><b> home - are happier, more productive, and genuinely meaningful” (Charles Duhigg, best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Power of Habit</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p><i>Out of Office</i> is a book for every office worker&nbsp;- from employees to managers - currently facing the decision about whether, and how, to return to the office. The past two years have shown us that there may be a new path forward, one that doesn’t involve hellish daily commutes and the demands of jam-packed work schedules that no longer make sense. But how can we realize that future in a way that benefits workers and companies alike?</p> <p>Based on groundbreaking reporting and interviews with workers and managers around the world,<i> Out of Office </i>illuminates the key values and questions that should be driving this conversation: trust, fairness, flexibility, inclusive workplaces, equity, and work-life balance. Above all, they argue that companies need to listen to their employees - and that this will promote, rather than impede, productivity and profitability. As a society, we have talked for decades about flexible work arrangements; this book makes clear that we are at an inflection point where this is actually possible for many employees and their companies.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Out of Office</i> is about so much more than Zoom meetings and hybrid schedules: It aims to reshape our entire relationship to the office.</p>";
