What makes us see violence as a kind of sacred duty, or a ritual that boys must undergo to \"become\" men? Newly reissued, <i>Blood Rites</i> takes listeners on an original journey from the elaborate human sacrifices of the ancient world to the carnage and holocaust of 20th-century \"total war.\"</p> <p>Ehrenreich sifts deftly through the fragile records of prehistory and discovers the wellspring of war in an unexpected place - not in a \"killer instinct\" unique to the males of our species, but in the blood rites early humans performed to reenact their terrifying experiences of predation by stronger carnivores.</p> <p>Brilliant in conception and rich in scope, <i>Blood Rites</i> is a monumental work that continues to transform our understanding of the greatest single threat to human life.</p>";
