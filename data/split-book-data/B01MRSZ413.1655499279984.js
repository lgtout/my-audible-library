window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the&nbsp;<i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Order of Time</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Helgoland</i>, a closer look at the mind-bending nature of the Universe.</p> <p>What are the elementary ingredients of the world? Do time and space exist? And what exactly is reality? Theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli has spent his life exploring these questions. He tells us how our understanding of reality has changed over the centuries and how physicists think about the structure of the Universe today.</p> <p>In elegant and accessible prose, Rovelli takes us on a wondrous journey from Democritus to Albert Einstein, from Michael Faraday to gravitational waves, and from classical physics to his own work in quantum gravity. As he shows us how the idea of reality has evolved over time, Rovelli offers deeper explanations of the theories he introduced so concisely in&nbsp;<i>Seven Brief Lessons on Physics</i>.</p> <p>This audiobook culminates in a lucid overview of quantum gravity, the field of research that explores the quantum nature of space and time, seeking to unify quantum mechanics, and general relativity. Rovelli invites us to imagine a marvelous world where space breaks up into tiny grains, time disappears at the smallest scales, and black holes are waiting to explode - a vast universe still largely undiscovered.</p>";
