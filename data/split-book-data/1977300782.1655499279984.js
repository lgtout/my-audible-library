window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Roderick Nash's classic study of changing attitudes toward wilderness during American history, as well as the origins of the environmental and conservation movements, has received wide acclaim since its initial publication in 1967. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> listed it among the 100 most influential books published in the last quarter century, <i>Outside </i>Magazine included it in a survey of \"books that changed our world\", and it has been called the \"Book of Genesis for environmentalists\".&nbsp;</p> <p>For the fifth edition, Nash has written a new preface and epilogue that brings <i>Wilderness and the American Mind</i> into dialogue with contemporary debates about wilderness. Char Miller's foreword provides a 21st-century perspective on how the environmental movement has changed, including the ways in which contemporary scholars are reimagining the dynamic relationship between the natural world and the built environment.</p>";
