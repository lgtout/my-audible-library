window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Wasted</i></b><b> is a riveting exploration of the complicated, and often surprising, ways that waste occurs in our businesses, our communities, and our lives</b></p> <p><b>\"A smart, unconventional book that takes readers far beyond what they </b><b><i>think</i></b><b> they know about a complex subject.\" (Kari Byron, former cast member of </b><b><i>MythBusters</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Waste. We spend a great deal of energy trying to avoid it, but once you train your eyes to look for it, you’ll see it all around you - in your home, your business, and your everyday life.</p> <p>In <i>Wasted,</i> futurist Byron Reese and entrepreneur Scott Hoffman take readers on a fascinating journey through this modern world of waste, drawing on science, economics, and human behavior to envision what a world with far less of it - or none of it at all - might look like. Along the way, they explore thought-provoking issues such as:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>why the United States got a higher proportion of its energy from renewable sources in 1950 than it does today&nbsp;</li> <li>whether the amount of gold in unused&nbsp;mobile phones can be extracted&nbsp;for profit</li> <li>how switching to water fountains on a single&nbsp;route&nbsp;from Singapore to Newark could prevent the use of 3,400 plastic bottles - on each flight</li> <li>whether the amount of money you save buying goods in bulk is offset by the amount you lose when some spoil.</li> </ul> <p>Ultimately, the question of reducing waste is scientific, philosophical, and, most of all, complex. According to Reese and Hoffman, the rush toward simple answers has often led to well-meaning efforts that cause more waste than they save. The only way we can hope to make progress is to treat waste as the complicated issue it is.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the authors don’t promise easy answers, in this compelling book&nbsp;they take an important step toward solutions by examining the questions at play, giving actionable steps, and ensuring that you’ll never see the world of waste the same way again.</p>";
