window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One of the preeminent linguists of our time examines the realms of language that are considered shocking and taboo in order to understand what imbues curse words with such power - and why we love them so much.</b></p> <p>Profanity has always been a deliciously vibrant part of our lexicon, an integral part of being human. In fact, our ability to curse comes from a different part of the brain than other parts of speech - the urgency with which we say \"f--k!\" is instead related to the instinct that tells us to flee from danger.</p> <p>Language evolves with time, and so does what we consider profane or unspeakable. <i>Nine Nasty Words</i> is a rollicking examination of profanity, explored from every angle: historical, sociological, political, linguistic. In a particularly coarse moment, when the public discourse is shaped in part by once-shocking words, nothing could be timelier.</p>";
