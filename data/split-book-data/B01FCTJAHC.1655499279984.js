window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Computers have changed since 1981, when Tracy Kidder memorably recorded the drama, comedy, and excitement of one company's efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations. <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i> is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the 20th century. </p>";
