window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Around the world, populist movements are gaining traction among the white working class. Meanwhile, members of the professional elite - journalists, managers, and establishment politicians - are on the outside looking in, left to argue over the reasons. In <i>White Working Class</i>, Joan C. Williams, described as having \"something approaching rock star status\" by the <i>New York Times</i>, explains why so much of the elite's analysis of the white working class is misguided, rooted in class cluelessness. </p> <p>Williams explains that many people have conflated \"working class\" with \"poor\" - but the working class is, in fact, the elusive, purportedly disappearing middle class. They often resent the poor and the professionals alike. But they don't resent the truly rich, nor are they particularly bothered by income inequality. Their dream is not to join the upper middle class, with its different culture, but to stay true to their own values in their own communities - just with more money. While white working-class motivations are often dismissed as racist or xenophobic, Williams shows that they have their own class consciousness. </p> <p><i>White Working Class</i> is a blunt, bracing narrative that sketches a nuanced portrait of millions of people who have proven to be a potent political force. For anyone stunned by the rise of populist, nationalist movements, wondering why so many would seemingly vote against their own economic interests, or simply feeling like a stranger in their own country, <i>White Working Class</i> will be a convincing primer on how to connect with a crucial set of workers - and voters. </p>";
