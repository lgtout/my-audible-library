In this ground-breaking book, Milkman reveals a proven path that can take you from where you are to where you want to be, with a foreword from psychologist Angela Duckworth, the best-selling author of </b><b><i>Grit</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Change comes most readily when you understand what's standing between you and success and tailor your solution to that roadblock.

But what if, instead, you transformed your workouts so they became a source of pleasure instead of a chore? Turning an uphill battle into a downhill one is the key to success.</p> <p>Drawing on Milkman's original research and the work of her world-renowned scientific collaborators, <i>How to Change</i> shares strategic methods for identifying and overcoming common barriers to change, such as impulsivity, procrastination, and forgetfulness.&nbsp;Through case studies and engaging stories, youâ€™ll learn:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Why timing can be everything when it comes to making a change</li> <li>How to turn temptation and inertia into assets&nbsp;</li> <li>That giving advice, even if it's about something you're struggling with, can help you achieve more</li> </ul> <p>Whether you're a manager, coach, or teacher aiming to help others change for the better or are struggling to kick-start change yourself, <i>How to Change</i> offers an invaluable, science-based blueprint for achieving your goals, once and for all.</p>";
