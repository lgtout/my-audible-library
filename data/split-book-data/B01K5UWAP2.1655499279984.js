window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the best-selling author of <i>Why We Get Fat</i>, a groundbreaking, eye-opening expos√© that makes the convincing case that sugar is the tobacco of the new millennium: backed by powerful lobbies, entrenched in our lives, and making us very sick.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among Americans, diabetes is more prevalent today than ever; obesity is at epidemic proportions; nearly 10 percent of children are thought to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. And sugar is at the root of these, and other, critical society-wide, health-related problems. With his signature command of both science and straight talk, Gary Taubes delves into Americans' history with sugar: its uses as a preservative, as an additive in cigarettes, the contemporary overuse of high-fructose corn syrup. He explains what research has shown about our addiction to sweets. He clarifies the arguments against sugar, corrects misconceptions about the relationship between sugar and weight loss, and provides the perspective necessary to make informed decisions about sugar as individuals and as a society.&nbsp;</p>";
