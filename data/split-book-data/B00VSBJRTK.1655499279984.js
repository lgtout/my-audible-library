window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What would it be like to really savor your food? Instead of grabbing a quick snack on your way out the door or eating just to calm down at the end of a stressful day, isn't it about time you let yourself truly appreciate a satisfying, nourishing meal? </p> <p>In our modern society, weight concerns, obesity rates, and obsession with appearance have changed the way we look at food - and not necessarily for the better. If you have ever snacked when you weren't hungry, have used guilt as a guide for your eating habits, or have cut calories even when you felt hungry, you have experienced \"mindless\" eating firsthand. This mindless approach to food is dangerous and can have serious health and emotional consequences. But if you've been mindlessly eating all your life, it can be difficult to make a change. When it comes down to it, you must take a whole new approach to eating - but where do you begin? Practicing mindful eating habits may be just the thing to make that important change. In fact it might just be the answer you've been searching for all these years. </p> <p>The breakthrough approaches in <i>Eating Mindfully</i> by Susan Albers use mindfulness-based psychological practices to take charge of cravings so people can eat when they are hungry and stop when they feel full. This audiobook helps listeners change the way they approach mealtime. It includes a section that focuses on the occasional mindless eater and emphasizes that mindful eating isn't only for those on diets or for those who have severely problematic eating habits - it's for everyone. It features over 50 new tips for eating mindfully. You will learn how to be more aware of what you eat and get to know your fullness and hunger cues and how to savor and appreciate every bite! </p>";
