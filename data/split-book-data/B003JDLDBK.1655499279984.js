window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Brainwave Symphony</i> combines carefully selected music from the baroque, classical, romantic, impressionistic, and 20th-century eras with breakthrough audio technology to give you the best of classical wisdom and modern science.</p> <p>We all experience many states of consciousness, from ordinary waking and sleeping states to extraordinary states in which we are more at peace, particularly aware, or unusually creative. Each state has a unique pattern of brainwaves that can be mapped and measured. <i>Brainwave Symphony</i> uses inaudible pulses of sound, based on these brain maps, to trigger your brain to produce the state you want to experience. Combining this powerful new recording process with carefully selected works of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Bach, and other masters offers a beautiful and unique listening experience as well as a powerful tool for personal transformation.</p> <b>Please note: This is a non-verbal meditation program.</b> <p></p>";
