window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Renowned psychologist Walter Mischel, designer of the famous Marshmallow Test, explains what self-control is and how to master it. </p> <p>A child is presented with a marshmallow and given a choice: Eat this one now, or wait and enjoy two later. What will she do? And what are the implications for her behavior later in life? </p> <p>The world's leading expert on self-control, Walter Mischel has proven that the ability to delay gratification is critical for a successful life, predicting higher SAT scores, better social and cognitive functioning, a healthier lifestyle and a greater sense of self-worth. But is willpower prewired, or can it be taught? </p> <p>In <i>The Marshmallow Test</i>, Mischel explains how self-control can be mastered and applied to challenges in everyday life - from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement. With profound implications for the choices we make in parenting, education, public policy and self-care, <i>The Marshmallow Test</i> will change the way you think about who we are and what we can be.</p>";
