window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Today busyness has become a badge of honour. We want to say we're busy, yet at the same time we feel exhausted. Instead we should start taking rest seriously as a method of self-care, and this book can help us to work out how.</p> <p><i>The Art of Rest</i> draws on groundbreaking research Claudia Hammond collaborated on - 'The Rest Test' - the largest global survey into rest ever undertaken, which was completed by 18,000 people across 135 different countries. Much of value has been written about sleep, but rest is different; it is how we unwind, calm our minds and recharge our bodies. And, as the survey revealed, how much rest you get is directly linked to your sense of well-being.</p> <p>Counting down through the top 10 activities which people find most restful, Hammond explains why rest matters, examines the science behind the results to establish what really works and offers a road map for a new, more restful and balanced life.</p>";
