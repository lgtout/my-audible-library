window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is my version of <i>Lovingkindness</i>, a Buddhist guided meditation. It is one of the most popular Buddhist meditations. It is designed to cultivate the habit of unconditional love and compassion for yourself and others. It works to soften your heart and break down the barriers that come in between you and your love for yourself and for others. </p> <p>There is an aphorism in the Buddhist tradition that says that hate and lovingkindness cannot co-exist in our hearts. This meditation will assist you in supplanting any hatred you hold in your heart with lovingkindness and will help you to make positive attitudinal changes that will heal your mind of confusion and doubt. Through its practice you will develop the habit of accepting yourself and others without judgment. </p> <p>Of all the Buddhist meditations, lovingkindness is thought to have the most immediate effect on shifting the negative thought patterns of your mind into positive ones. No matter the degree you allow negative thought patterns to dominate your thinking, supplanting them with lovingkindness will improve your life experience. </p>";
