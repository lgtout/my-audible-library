window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The inspiration for the PBS series <i>Mysterious of Mental Illness</i>, <i>Shrinks</i>&nbsp;brilliantly tells the&nbsp;\"astonishing\" story of psychiatry's origins, demise, and redemption&nbsp;(Siddhartha Mukherjee).</p> <p>Psychiatry has come a long way since the days of chaining \"lunatics\" in cold cells and parading them as freakish marvels before a gaping public.</p> <p>But, as Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, the former president of the American Psychiatric Association, reveals in his extraordinary and eye-opening audiobook, the path to legitimacy for \"the black sheep of medicine\" has been anything but smooth.</p> <p>In <i>Shrinks</i>, Dr. Lieberman traces the field from its birth as a mystic pseudo-science through its adolescence as a cult of \"shrinks\" to its late blooming maturity - beginning after World War II - as a science-driven profession that saves lives. With fascinating case studies and portraits of the luminaries of the field - from Sigmund Freud to Eric Kandel - <i>Shrinks</i> is a gripping and illuminating listen, and an urgent call-to-arms to dispel the stigma of mental illnesses by treating them as diseases rather than unfortunate states of mind.</p>";
