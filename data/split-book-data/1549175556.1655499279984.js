window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An award-winning food writer takes us on a global tour of what the world eats - and shows us how we can change it for the better</b></p> <p>Food is one of life's great joys. So why has eating become such a source of anxiety and confusion?</p> <p>Bee Wilson shows that in two generations the world has undergone a massive shift from traditional, limited diets to more globalized ways of eating, from bubble tea to quinoa, from Soylent to meal kits.</p> <p>Paradoxically, our diets are getting healthier and less healthy at the same time. For some, there has never been a happier food era than today: a time of unusual herbs, farmers' markets, and internet recipe swaps. Yet modern food also kills - diabetes and heart disease are on the rise everywhere on earth.</p> <p>This is a book about the good, the terrible, and the avocado toast. A riveting exploration of the hidden forces behind what we eat, <i>The Way We Eat Now </i>explains how this food revolution has transformed our bodies, our social lives, and the world we live in.</p>";
