window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The legendary British actor Terence Stamp reads the book that he says 'changed his life'. This is an exploration of our existence and a journey towards enlightenment. </p> <p>In what the author calls 'the fine print' at the start of the book, David Carse wrote: 'There are many books out there that will help you to live a better life, become a better person, and evolve and grow to realise your potential as a spiritual being. This is not one of them...almost every popular spiritual teacher in America and Europe is teaching that ultimate spiritual enlightenment...can now be yours; and that reading their book or attending their seminar will help you toward that end. This book will tell you that these ideas are absurd, because it’s quite obvious that neither you nor anything else has ever existed....' He then concludes, 'That said, enjoy'. We think you probably will.</p>";
