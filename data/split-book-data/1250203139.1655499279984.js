window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"This well-produced audiobook is also well researched, and well intentioned.\" (</b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b>)&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>This program includes an introduction read by the author. </b></p> <p><b>A riveting tour through the landscape and meaning of modern conspiracy theories, exploring the causes and tenacity of this American malady, from birthers to Pizzagate and beyond. </b></p> <p>American society has always been fertile ground for conspiracy theories, but with the election of Donald Trump, previously outlandish ideas suddenly attained legitimacy. Trump himself is a conspiracy enthusiast: from his claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax to the accusations of “fake news”, he has fanned the flames of suspicion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But it was not by the power of one man alone that these ideas gained new power. <i>Republic of Lies</i> looks beyond the caricatures of conspiracy theorists to explain their tenacity. Without lending the theories validity, Anna Merlan gives a nuanced, sympathetic account of the people behind them, across the political spectrum, and the circumstances that helped them take hold. The lack of a social safety net, inadequate education, bitter culture wars, and years of economic insecurity have created large groups of people who feel forgotten by their government and even besieged by it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Our contemporary conditions are a perfect petri dish for conspiracy movements: a durable, permanent, elastic climate of alienation and resentment. All the while, an army of politicians and conspiracy peddlers has fanned the flames of suspicion to serve their own ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Bringing together penetrating historical analysis and gripping on-the-ground reporting, </b><b><i>Republic of Lies </i></b><b>transforms our understanding of American paranoia. </b></p>";
