window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Die Wise</i> does not offer seven steps for coping with death. It does not suggest ways to make dying easier. It pours no honey to make the medicine go down. Instead, with lyrical prose, deep wisdom, and stories from his two decades of working with dying people and their families, Stephen Jenkinson places death at the center of the discussion and asks us to behold it in all its painful beauty. <i>Die Wise</i> teaches the skills of dying, skills that have to be learned in the course of living deeply and well. <i>Die Wise </i>is for those who will fail to live forever. </p> <p>Dying well, Jenkinson writes, is a right and responsibility of everyone. It is not a lifestyle option. It is a moral, political, and spiritual obligation all people owe their ancestors and their heirs. <i>Die Wise</i> dreams such a dream and plots such an uprising. How we die, how we care for dying people, and how we carry our dead: This work makes our capacity for a village-mindedness - or breaks it. </p>";
