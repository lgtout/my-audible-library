window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The acclaimed author of </b><b><i>Einstein’s Dreams</i></b><b> tackles \"big questions like the origin of the universe and the nature of consciousness...in an entertaining and easily digestible way” (</b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b>) with a collection of meditative essays on the possibilities - and impossibilities - of nothingness and infinity, and how our place in the cosmos falls somewhere in between.</b></p> <p>Can space be divided into smaller and smaller units, ad infinitum? Does space extend to larger and larger regions, on and on to infinity<i>? </i>Is consciousness reducible to the material brain and its neurons? What was the origin of life, and can biologists create life from scratch in the lab?</p> <p>Physicist and novelist Alan Lightman, whom <i>The Washington Post </i>has called “the poet laureate of science writers”, explores these questions and more - from the anatomy of a smile to the capriciousness of memory to the specialness of life in the universe to what came before the Big Bang.</p> <p><i>Probable Impossibilities </i>is a deeply engaged consideration of what we know of the universe, of life and the mind, and of things vastly larger and smaller than ourselves.</p>";
