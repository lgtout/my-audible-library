window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"A powerful work of spirituality and anti-racism.\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p>\"If you read one book in 2020, make it this one.\" (<i>Tricycle</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p><b>From much-admired meditation expert Sebene Selassie,&nbsp;</b><b><i>You Belong</i></b><b>&nbsp;is a call to action, exploring our tangled relationship with belonging, connection, and each other </b></p> <p>You are not separate. You never were. You never will be.We are not separate from each other. But we don’t always believe it, and we certainly don’t always practice it. In fact, we often practice the opposite - disconnection and domination.&nbsp; From unconscious bias to “cancel culture”, denial of our inherent interconnection limits our own freedom.&nbsp;</p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>You Belong</i>, much-admired meditation expert Sebene Selassie reveals that accepting our belonging is the key to facing the many challenges currently impacting our world. Using ancient philosophy, multidisciplinary research, exquisite storytelling, and razor-sharp wit, Selassie leads us in an exploration of all the ways we separate (and thus suffer) and offers a map back to belonging.&nbsp;To belong is to experience joy in any moment: to feel pleasure, dance in public, accept death, forgive what seems unforgivable, and extend kindness to yourself and others. To belong is also to acknowledge injustice, reckon with history, and face our own shadows.&nbsp;</p> <p>Full of practical advice and profound revelations, <i>You Belong</i> makes a winning case for resisting the forces that demand separation and reclaiming the connection - and belonging - that have been ours all along.&nbsp;</p> <p>Supplemental enhancement PDF accompanies the audiobook.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
