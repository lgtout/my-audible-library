window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From one of the most brilliant minds of our time comes an audiobook that clarifies his most important ideas.</p> <p>Stephen Hawking’s worldwide best seller <i>A Brief History of Time</i> remains a landmark volume in scientific writing. But for those who have asked for a more accessible formulation of its key concepts - the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, and the history and future of the universe - <i>A Briefer History of Time</i> is Professor Hawking’s response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Although “briefer”, this audiobook is much more than a mere explanation of Hawking’s earlier work. <i>A Briefer History of Time</i> both clarifies and expands on the great subjects of the original and records the latest developments in the field - from string theory to the search for a unified theory of all the forces of physics. Thirty-seven full-color illustrations enhance the text and make <i>A Briefer History of Time </i>an exhilarating and must-have addition in its own right to the great literature of science and ideas.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
