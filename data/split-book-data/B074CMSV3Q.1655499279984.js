window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Teachings and meditations to \"shift\" into the freedom of awakening. </p> <p>It is possible to access the same sense of well-being, clarity, inner freedom, and loving connection realized by the world's meditation masters. We can do this by shifting our awareness in the midst of our daily lives. <i>Shift into Freedom</i> is an unabridged audiobook presentation of innovative teacher Loch Kelly's training manual for actively participating in the evolution of your own consciousness. </p> <p>Synthesizing insights from neuroscience and psychology with wisdom from the world's contemplative traditions, <i>Shift into Freedom</i> offers an accessible and remarkably powerful series of meditations that lead us to a little-known natural capacity called \"awake awareness\". Through an unfolding process of \"small glimpses, many times\", these exercises shift us from a thought-based knowing to an awareness-based way of operating in the world. </p> <p>With continued practice, we learn to \"unhook\" from our customary home in our ego-based identity - and then sustain an embodied presence and relatedness known as \"open-hearted awareness\". Loch Kelly teaches that this is \"the meeting place of awakening and growing up, where we have the capacity to handle a fully emotional, intimate life and act with authenticity and compassion.\" </p> <p>\"The goal of these meditations is not to transcend the human condition,\" explains Loch Kelly, \"but to discover how to live a fully intimate human life.\" <i>Shift into Freedom</i> gives you the tools to navigate your life with clarity and unconditional love. </p>";
