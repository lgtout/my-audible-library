window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The definitive account of Germany's malign transformation under Hitler's total rule and the implacable march to war. This magnificent second volume of Richard J. Evans's three-volume history of Nazi Germany was hailed by Benjamin Schwartz of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> as \"the definitive English-language account... gripping and precise.\" It chronicles the incredible story of Germany's radical reshaping under Nazi rule. As those who were deemed unworthy to be counted among the German people were dealt with in increasingly brutal terms, Hitler's drive to prepare Germany for the war that he saw as its destiny reached its fateful hour in September 1939.</p> <p><i>The Third Reich in Power</i> is the fullest and most authoritative account yet written of how, in six years, Germany was brought to the edge of that terrible abyss.</p>";
