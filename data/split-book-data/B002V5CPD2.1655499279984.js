Callahan thinks most people would overdraw their accounts, like the 4,000 people who helped themselves to 15 million dollars from the Municipal Credit Union of New York following the September 11 terrorist attacks. America has become a nation of cheaters. Now more than ever, people are bending rules and breaking laws to get what they want.</p><p> From the Enron scandal to the dot-com collapses to the plagiarism that has rocked the publishing world, this remarkable book exposes the new culture of cheating while offering reasonable suggestions for righting the wrongs.</p>";
